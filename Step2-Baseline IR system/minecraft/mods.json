In the 1.16.5 version portals can be disabled using /gamerule infiniteAbyssPortalsEnabled false so the only way to get to them will be digging.Dimension stacking is not on by default, you will need both 1.16.5, the Immersive Portals mod and to enable dimension stacking, there is a tutorial on that here: https://qouteall.fun/immptl/wiki/Dimension-Stack.html Portal creation:Layer 1 portal: Amethyst blocks and Amethyst Key (Key is craftable)Layer 2 portal: Deepstone blocks and Pink Crystal Key (Key is craftable)Layer 3 portal: Standard Nether portal (Flint and Steel is craftable)Layer 4 portal: Layer 2 Red Deepstone and Red Crystal Key (Key is craftable)Layer 5 portal: Third Layer Deepstone and Opal Key (Key is craftable)Layer 6 portal: Deep Prismarine and Frozen Key (Key is a 5% drop from Guardian Knights)Layer 7 portal: Blue Ice and Shadow Key (Key is a 5% drop from Wind Spirits)Use JEI with this so you know how to craft things, or JER to get info on loot tables/ore generation, also for other info like tool strength needed to break blocks you can use mods like this or thisMod wiki: https://www.planetminecraft.com/blog/infinite-abyss-wiki/ If you wish to include this in a modpack please contact me.FAQWill you made a Fabric version? No, I can't and won't.Can I post this to another site? No. I will attempt to get reposts of the mod taken down.Will this mod be made to work in version X? I have no plans to make versions of this mod for older versions of the game, a 1.12.2 or 1.15.2 version would take too long to make and the workspace for the mod is not compatible with older versions of Mcreator. I might however update this mod to 1.20 when the update is out.What version should I use? The 1.18.2/1.19.2 versions generally look better since they have dripstone, however only the 1.16.5 version is currently compatible with Immersive Portals dimension stacking and has custom super deep mineshafts so you may wish to use the 1.16.5 version instead. The 1.16.5 version also has 256 block high dimensions to make it work better with Immersive Portals, whereas the 1.18.2/1.19.2 versions has 128 block high dimensions. The 1.16.5 version might run slower than the 1.18.2/1.19.2 versions due to increased dimension height (although that hasn't been tested) so if you are experiencing lag it may be best to use the 1.18.2/1.19.2 versions.Are there any Incompatibilities? I do not know of any specific incompatibilities between this mod and other mods, however if you are using the 1.16.5 version with Immersive Portals then check here to see if other mods you want to use are compatible or notHow finished is the mod? Since this is the first release of the mod, some features will likely be changed or replaced based on my own ideas and community feedback, this version of the mod is, as far as I know, playable and enjoyable to play, however it is likely not finished, few mods only get one published version.Does it work for multiplayer? I think so, I see no reason why it wouldn't, if you do find any problems please report them.Made with Mcreator", "Published time": "10/3/22 3:52 am", "Views": 1628, "Downloads": 151, "Credit": null, "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.19.2", "Tags": "New Content, Mod, Forge, Free, Download, Mining, Modded, Dimension, Cave, Bosses, Dimensions, Underground, Crystals, Deep, Dimention, Dreamcritting, Dimension Mod, Mcmod, Crystal Cave, Caverns, Charya, Crystal Construct, Frozen Wither, Infiniteabyss, Infinite Abyss, Abyss, Dimension Stacking, Downloadable"},

{"Title": "CrimsonSteve's more mobs", "Description": "Summary:This mod adds many random mobs. For now, there are 27 mobs in total.Explanation of mobs:redstone powered iron golemVillagers needed a better bodyguard than default iron golems, so they researched illager's and made their own. This mob naturally spawns in the village rarely, protecting villagers from monsters and raids. Occasionally rushes toward its target and deals massive damage.In the future, some villagers with a specific profession will sell this massive golem.big snow golemThis mob spawns in snowy biomes rarely and can be tamed with a carved pumpkin. You can also heal it with snowballs after taming it. Throws big snowballs toward its target, and sometimes it uses its offhand to shoot a large amount of snowballs. Its attack continuously freezes targets, and when it attacks a completely frozen target, it defrosts the target and deals additional damage.reanimated templeA kind of boss in this mod, spawning in the jungle. It wields its arms for attacks, causing earthquakes that deal additional damage. Damage of its attacks is based on its attack-damage amount.crude redstone monstrositySeems that illagers used the wrong blueprint. Yet, it is strong enough. It occasionally opens its belly and casts a special attack.1. Summoning minion golems2. Shooting redstone bombs.Also, it generates some long-ranged earthquakes toward its target.For now, it appears in the raids only.redstone monstrosityIllagers finally got the right blueprint! This giant monster has three attacks for now.1. Swinging its arms2. Inserting the arms and summoning minions3. Shooting redstone bombsAlso, its attack speed increases as its health get lower.HP  attack speed75%  25%50%  50%25%  75%For now, it appears in the raids only.elite ender ravagerIt spawns rarely in the ender world or overworld. It has a massive amount of damage, but there's some delay until the attack hits the target, so using ranged weapons to stop its attacks is recommended highly. Also, it is stunned for a while if you block its attacks with the shield, like usual ravagers.zombified illagersThey spawn at night and have similar properties to their original form, except the zombie evoker. It has four attacks in total.These are the lists of its attacks.1. Summoning 3 zombie illagers2. Summoning evoker fangs near the target for about 2 seconds3. Summoning a zombie ravager4. Making a cloud of instant damage effectphantom tamerAn illager that loves collecting and training phantoms to its own taste. It spawns at night very rarely or raids, and has 5 attacks in total.1. Generating earthquakes around it2. Summoning magical projectiles that falls after a few seconds3. Summoning two usual phantoms4. Summoning an explosive phantom5. Summoning a giant phantom and riding itSummoned phantoms have their lifetime like vexes summoned by evokers.cyborg vindicatorA giant & muscular vindicator made with some chemicals and mechanical stuff. It appears in the raids or patrol troops. For the patrol troops, it only appears when the world time is more than 360000, 15 days of minecraft. Sometimes, it runs in the place for a while and rushes toward its target. The direction of it won't change once start rushing. While rushing, it deals damage to all non-allied mobs in its way and makes explosions when the rush ends.When its health is below 40%, it starts fixing itself to full health. This can be recharged as time passes.Even after death, it will stand back and become raged state. In this state, its health wipes out at a constant rate based on its max health.T-rabusIllagers got a hoglin from nether and made it into the massive war machine. It only spawns in the raids.Its battle style is like a bulldozer, moving fast and dealing massive area damage and knockback to its enemies, confusing the battlefield. You will need a bucket of water when fighting against it, or you are highly likely to be killed from falling.There are some mobs I didn't explain above.

{"Title": "Mob Vote '22", "Description": "A mod that adds the Sniffer, Rascal, and Tuff Golem from the 2022 mob vote as well as what they could / could have brought to the game with them.- About -- Sniffer - The first fluffy looking mob seen in the mob vote. (And winner of the vote!) - Sniffers are large prehistoric mobs that love nature, especially flowers! - Sniffers have short red hair and long greenish-blue hair on their body. (Often leaves and twigs get caught in their long hair!) - They have gone almost extinct over the centuries but some of their eggs can be found dormant at the bottom of the ocean. (Usually in certain underwater ruins.) - Sniffer eggs will only hatch when placed on dry land under the warmth of the sun. - Be careful, sniffer eggs are extremely fragile and anything stepping or falling on them could break it! - After a while the egg will hatch into a baby sniffer and then mature into an adult. - Once an adult sniffers can be given any type of flower to sniff. - When given a flower sniffers will sniff out and dig up old and unknown seeds depending on the terrain!(Grassy or dirt-like blocks will give mysterious seeds. Sandy type blocks will give glowing seeds. Rough blocks like gravel will give spiny seeds. Sniffers are unable to dig into solid surfaces like stone.) - Sniffers can dig the best on flat surfaces as it's hard for them to dig on slopes!- New Seeds - The long forgotten seeds that can be dug up by the sniffer. - These seeds can be planted anywhere in dirt or grass. - You can use bone meal on any of these new plants like any other crop.- Mysterious seeds:- These old seeds will sprout a vine that grows mysterious fruits.- These special fruits seem to have a random effect on whoever eats them. (Sometimes good sometimes bad.) - Sniffers absolutely love these tiny fruits as they are unaffected by them unlike players. - Mysterious fruits can be used to speed up the growth of baby sniffers as well as breed adult sniffers!- Glowing Seeds:- These shiny seeds seem to produce light even as a seed. - The more the plant grows the brighter the light it produces becomes.- When fully grown you can harvest the glowing flower from them. - This flower can be used with sticks to make a glowing flower torch. - These flowers also double as food! (They don't provide much food though.)- Spiny Seeds:- These spiked seeds will grow into a thorny bush over time. (They're painful to walk through!)- When fully grown these bushes will produce the long lost cyan rose! - Cyan roses can be picked and planted individually. - They can also be used to craft cyan dye - Rascal - The second mischievous mob seen in the mob vote. - Rascals live deep underground in caves and mineshafts. - They love to play hide and seek with everyone! - Right-click a rascal to find them. (It's more like hide and seek tag.) - When found a rascal might throw a special potion that helps them hide but makes it harder for you to find them if you get caught in the splash. (Crafty!) - When found 3 times a rascal will give you a random reward as a thanks for playing! - These rewards can vary between tools, ores, or even ancient treasures!- Ancient Treasures:- These are tools made of deepslate and reinforced with skulk and ancient bone!- A rascal can give you tools made of this material or even just the raw ancient bones! - Ancient bones are a super sturdy material made of similar parts seen in reinforced deepslate. (How did the rascal get a hold of these?) - Tools can be crafted like normal and repaired using these mysterious materials. - These tools seem to be the middle ground between iron and diamond.- Tuff Golem - The third mob, a statue come to life seen in the mob vote. - Can be crafted using a pumpkin on top of a carpet on top of a tuff block in a crafting table. (How do pumpkins seemingly bring golems to life? Has nobody researched this?) - The tuff golem has the ability to transform between a living entity and a stone statue! - When right clicked while sneaking you can transform this statue between living and stone. - They have a strange obsession with holding items. (Especially hats.) - Tuff golems will follow players holding a leather hat. - When right clicked with an item (Only leather hats for now (I'm not that good at coding)) they will hold it using their cloth and arms as a built in display stand! - When right clicked again they will give it back. - Tuff golems can be given items to display in both living and statue form!", "Published time": "11/8/22 9:35 am", "Views": 310, "Downloads": 88, "Credit": "Mob vote mob concepts by Mojang", "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.19.2", "Tags": "New Content, Mod, Tools, Mobs, Tool, Mob, Plants, Flowers, Hat, Hats, Sniffer, Mobvote, Rascal, Mobvote2022, Tuffgolem, Nickyb1106"},

A bit soon for another update I know, but I was REALLY motivated especially for Halloween Decor it seems!

This one also comes with a LOT of recipes, so I HIGHLY recommend using mods like Just Enough Items for them! At this point I might have to start a wiki...A new plant has ALSO been Added, the Cream Rose, which can be found in Flower Forests a little rarely!ALSO NOTE: On the Bird Bath Recipe, there is an Error on the kind of Nether Quartz you need, for some reason it requires the Raw Ore, so either I suggest Creative-ing it in for builds, or using silk touch on Nether Quartz Blocks until a fix is added in the next update!HAPPY BUILDING!!!!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------6/30/2022 UpdateFalling Gravity Set (Just straight-up Gravity Falls-inspired Set tbh)REMEMBER TO DELETE THE OLD VERSION OF THE MOD BEFORE UPDATINGHere comes the newest set, the Falling Gravity set partly inspired by Gravity Falls and the like! Also unlike previous sets, this one has more traditional recipes rather than the usual one involving the Stonecutter. You can view the recipes for this set below!Falling Gravity Set Recipes----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------5/29/2022 UpdateThe Magical Nyan-Chan SetREMEMBER TO DELETE THE OLD VERSION OF THE MOD BEFORE UPDATINGHappy to announce the next Emporium set, the Magical Nyan-Chan set! This time around, this set has a focus less on furniture and more on decor items and blocks, such as the wallpaper, flooring, plushies, a lamp and two TVs-one off, and one ON that has an animated texture! This set is inspired by classic Magical Girl anime like Sailor Moon, so hoping you all enjoy using these items in your builds!ALSO some news on Backporting:I'm currently in the process of Backporting for 1.12.2, HOWEVER I've run into problems, as I'm using an older version of Mcreator with a plugin to achieve this, one of said problems actually affected the 1.16.5 version Somehow:- For some reason the 'Living Entities' (Cushion and Chair) vanished from the 1.16.5 Mcreator Workspace so I had to re-add them. Appologies in advance if this affects any you might have placed in your game!- For some reason, the doors I made for these sets just REEFUSE to work in the 1.12.2, so appologies but the backport may not have any of my doors :c People are ABSOLUTELY free to make their own backports/addons tho!I will do my best with this backport as humanly possible while also doing my best to maintain the current 1.16.5 version's updates!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3/31/2022 UpdateThe Black Gold SetI'm very excited to be adding the next set of furniture to the Emporium mod! The Black Gold set is once again a simple to craft set too, all you need is to place a block of Gilded Blackstone for ANY Block from the set! It's a bold but elegant set that's somewhat inspired by Art Deco!Quick Note About the Black Gold Chair:In order to make the chair face the way you want, you need to crouch and hit it with an empty hand until it faces the right direction.Yes, really :'D----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm pleased to introduce The Emporium Mod, a furniture and decor mod with a focus and emphasis on themed furniture and block sets! I decided to go ahead and share this mod with the First Set, the Night Sky Set, now that it's been completed, with plans to release more in the future! Also because the focus is on furniture and decor, crafting each piece is INCREDIBLY easy, as all you need to do is craft the Initial Night Sky Blocks, and then place them in a Stone Cutter for the rest of the decor! There's also plans for more set themes in the future, so hopefully there'll be plenty of variety and options for decorating!

These arrows come in 12 new types and 4 new tiers. The types are:The Explosive ArrowThe Vexing ArrowThe Atlantean ArrowThe Tracking ArrowThe Ender ArrowThe Lightning ArrowThe Torch ArrowThe Redstone Torch ArrowThe Soul Torch ArrowThe Slime ArrowThe Padded ArrowThe Headless Arrow== Every Arrow Except the Padded and Headless Arrow can be Upgraded into 4 unique tiers ==IronGoldenDiamondNetherite- For More about each of these tiers, and their special abilities, Scroll down and read the Tiered Arrows section.Arrow Types:A Detailed Look At Each Arrow TypeExplosive Arrows:The explosive arrow causes an explosion upon impact with a target. Though these explosions are of lesser size than a TNT explosion, they are not to be underestimated. Tracking ArrowsPowered by Eyes of Ender, the tracking arrow locks onto your targets and pursues them. This powerful arrow will make your shots count for you (The last mob you hit is the mob which it will track).  Vexing Arrows:The Vexing Arrow has the ability to traverse through solid blocks. It captures the power of the Vex with its Vex Wings, which are obtained by killing Vex. Those annoying little things now have a use! Note: This arrow does not phase through Bedrock or Obsidian. This is intentional.Ender Arrows:The ender arrow is essentially an ender pearl which can be shot longer distances with bow/crossbow. Take your enemies by surprise. Lightning Arrows:The lightning arrow is lined with copper, which calls lightning down upon your foes! The power of Zeus is in your hands. Torch Arrows:The torch arrow is very much a utility arrow. It will place a torch where it is shot. This can be very useful in dark areas such as caves. Redstone Torch Arrows:The redstone torch arrow is very much similar to the torch arrow. The difference lies in its ability to place redstone torches rather than normal torches. This opens up new possibilities for wireless redstone signals.  Soul Torch Arrows:The soul torch arrow is much like the torch arrow. It will place soul torches rather than regular torches. Slime Arrows:The slime arrow is a bouncy, unpredictable arrow. It is covered in slime, which causes it to constantly bounce off walls at high speeds and distances. Padded Arrows:The padded arrow can be described as a practice arrow. It has no arrowhead, and is instead covered by wool padding at the tip. This will cause the arrow to deal no damage and fall off walls constantly.Atlantean Arrows:The Atlantean arrow is extremely useful for ranged, underwater combat. This arrow has the same inertia underwater as it does on land, meaning water does not slow it down.Tiered Arrows:This mod adds several different tiers of arrow. Reveal the spoiler to view them.===Flint: This is the base arrow of Minecraft.Iron: This arrow deals +2 damage in relation to the Flint Arrow.Golden: This arrow's damage differs dependent on the dimension you are in. It will deal +3 damage in relation to the Flint Arrow if used against creatures of the Nether. It will deal -1 damage in relation to the Flint Arrow if used against anything else. Piglins will take these arrows if dropped on the ground.Diamond: This arrow deals +4 damage in relation to the Flint Arrow. It will also disable shields temporarily.Netherite: This arrow deals +6 damage in relation to the Flint Arrow. It will also disable shields temorarily.Configuration Options:Xtra Arrows is highly configurable. Reveal the spoiler to see your options.===Each config option can be found in .minecraft/config/#- Ability to Enable/Disable Explosive Arrows.- Ability to modify whether or not Explosive Arrows will deal damage to the world (Such as breaking blocks).- Ability to modify the radius of Explosive Arrow Explosions (Modifiable up to 1,000.

They move faster, do more damage, have more health, and gain improved abilities! Do you think you have what it takes to even survive 5 days? Test your luck, and download it now!Is it really that hard? Yes, yes it is. We had over 10 people try it out, and none could last longer than a few days.

Even then, you are still faced with challenges such as food, resources, and most importantly, mobs! Even worse, the difficulty is locked on hard mode. Don't believe me? Just check out the stats on some of the mobs!  What do the numbers mean?The first number, (health) shows how many hitpoints (half hearts) they have. The next stat (damage) tells you how many half-hearts the take from you on hit. The next stat, speed, tells you how fast they move, relative to a player that is sprinting and jumping. The first optional stat: The bow and arrow, tells you how much damage they do with a ranged weapon. The \"TNT\" icon, tells you how much more powerful their attack is, in comparison to a block of tnt. The ladder icon tells you if they can climb walls. The Splash potion stats tells you how many potions they shoot per second, and the normal potion stat tells you how fast they can drink potions. Got it?

{"Title": "Dog-inator 3000", "Description": "Turn your favorite pet into a massive boss dog!With this fun little addon, you can have massive pet dogs that have much more hp than usual, are much bigger, and much faster! The best part is, turning your wolf pet into a boss dog is as easy as pie.This dog will also remain loyal towards you, even after enlargment. A boss bar will also appear, so you know exactly how much health your canine friend has. However, when you turn your wolf into a mega-dog, you're doing to need to feed it lots and lots of treats! (So it can fill in all the new health). How much stronger does my dog get?Well, mathematically speaking, the wolf will do x4 damage, which is great, but it gets even better. The wolf's size and speed means it can tank lots of hits for you, without worry of you getting hit. Although this all sounds great, (and it is), the best feature about your dog will be its health. After buffing your dog, it will gain 256x its previous hp, making it the highest hp mob in the game! (Even more than an ender dragon.)There's a catch, however. As previously mentioned, when the wolf turns into boss form, it will start off with the same amount of hp it had before, meaning you need to heal it immediately. If you don't, well, that wolf of yours is a goner!x256 Hpx4 Sizex4 Damage How to bossify my dog?Make sure cheats are enabled, walk up to your dog, and write this exact command in chat: /event entity @e[type=wolf,c=1] wolf:boss Make sure to auto-fill the \"wolf:boss\" at the end to whatever the game recommends, or else it won't work.  (Hint: Just write boss instead of wolf boss and see what it recommends.)

{"Title": "WhitchCraft", "Description": "WhitchCraftFor 1.18.2Hello all, I'm UndeadGmrDad and this is my mod.In WhitchCraft you become a Spell-slinging Wizard.Master your elemental spells.Unlock 10 Professions that allow you to craft new items, and vanilla items that are hard to obtain.Finish Quests to further your magical powers as a wizard.Fight Bosses for loot and XP.What's New!V1.2.0A new block called \"Blacksmiths Forge\" This block can smelt entire Stacks at once! But uses 16 coal every smelt. All Fuel sources can be used, including a bucket of lava.The temperature needs to be maintained in the Blacksmiths Forge to complete its process. This can be done with either Fire Crystals or by Placing the new \"Bellow\" block beside it and Right-Clicking the Bellow continuously.The new \"Elemental Imbuer\"!The Elemental Imbuer imbues uncharged crystals with Elemental energy. Open the GUI, click which element you want to imbue the crystal with and the recipe will pop up.2 New Ores! Uncharged Crystal Ore and Sarium Ore.RareMetal has had its name changed to Sarium, and can now be mined instead of found only in Crypt Chests.Uncharged Crystal Ore requires an Iron Pickaxe at minimum and Sarium Ore Requires a Diamond Pickaxe.The Engineer Workbench has been REWORKED to Show Recipes at the click of a button, and now has a process time.The Merchant Stall has also been REWORKED, Now it contains 12 Item slots, and items placed in the inventory will slowly be sold for CS to the Mage Market(Coming soon).All other fixes and additions will be listed in the Changelog.In WhitchCraft you can cast spells from your fingers, rather than from wands or other items. Have you ever been mining and a zombie sneaks up on you, you need to fiddle around and equip your sword. Not in WhitchCraft. Turn around and Blast him with a fireball! Mage TypesThere are 4 Elements to choose from. Air, Fire, Earth and Water. Each with its own strengths. Each Element has 5 Upgradable spells to master and bring your enemies to their knees.Air Mages use an AirBolt to push back enemies and deal damage. A buff that makes you faster, and jump higher and gives haste. Air Burst pushes all mobs away and launches you into the air, also refreshing the cooldown of AirBolt over and over, allowing you to cast AirBolt continuously while slowfalling to the ground. SonicBoom Blasts you forward a good distance, while doing damage to any mob you pass through. Tornado is the Ultimate ability of the Air mage, pulling mobs towards you and launching them into the air for a period of time, doing good damage while they are suspended in your vortex.Fire Mages throw fireballs that set mobs on fire. A buff that gives them fire resistance, speed, and resistance. FireWave erupts the area around you in flames, burning and doing damage to mobs around you. FireBlast Explodes in an area you are looking, dealing instant damage and setting all mobs on fire. MeteorStorm rains flaming meteors from the sky all around you, causing fiery explosions and dealing great damage.Earth Mages must be on the ground to cast their spells. They pull a block from the ground and throw it where your aiming, destroying other blocks it hits. The buff gives you strength, resistance, and absorption. They can construct a Wall in front of them, blocking enemies from attacking them. They can leap into the air, destroying the earth below them from the force of the leap, only to land and cause great damage and destruction to both mobs and blocks. Their Ultimate is Earthquake, which causes the earth to break below your feet, causing lots of damage to all enemies touching the ground, while also giving them slowness and nausea to mimic shaking. *Do not cast these spells inside your base!*Water Mages throw a stream of water to damage foes. Their buff gives them water breathing and night vision (dolphins grace at higher level). WaterWave creates water droplets all around you that damage mobs near you, after which the droplets launch in the direction you are looking. They also change direction if you look a different direction! Undertoe will create a pool of water under the mob struck and pull them under continuously to drown them, after some time, the hole is filled back in with sand. Their Ultimate is called Dehydrate. All spells cast apply a \"wet\" effect on the mob hit, this effect stacks up to 3 times and can be seen on the mob by dripping water. Dehydrate does instant damage to the mob depending on how many stacks of \"wet\" the mob has, this can effect any mob effected by \"wet\" around you.When you finish the first quest, you will be prompted to choose 1 Element. This is a permanent decision. Progressing through the quests, after this element is fully mastered, you may choose a second element. After mastering the second element you will be able to move onto Specialty Mage classes.Currently only the Necromancer specialty Class exsists.Necromancers must finish quests to unlock all their spells. The first spell is called Leach, it fires a projectile that damages enemies and heals you. If you run out of mana, leach will use your HP instead, this CAN kill you. Necromancers buff gives you instant health, health boost, and absorption, but also gives you wither. Necromancers 3rd spell is Summon Minion, this summons a small skeleton minion that will fight for you. To start, you may only have 3 Skeleton minions summoned at once, but quests can increase this number INFINITITLY. His 4th spell Buffs all his minions making them stronger and faster for some time, and fully heals their HP. His Ultimate is called Sacrifice, this sacrifices all his skeleton minions and if you had the max number summoned, summons a Demon that fights for you for a period of time. If you didn't have the max number of skeletons summoned, you receive a Big regeneration and strength buff, while also giving wither to all mobs around you.The skeletons and demon gain XP when they kill an enemy. After they gain enough XP, they will level up, gaining new attributes, such as more armour, more damage, more health, and more movement speed.ProfessionsThere are 10 professions in WhitchCraft. The Alchemist, Apothecary, Blacksmith, Clothier, Enchanter, Engineer, Herbalist, Merchant, Scholar, and Treasure Hunter.Alchemists use an Alchemist Bench to change items into other items. They require \"Alchemical Leftovers\" to proceed with any craft. Apothecaries use an Apothecary Table to brew potions. They require a Beaker to perform all crafts. They can brew almost all vanilla potions at their stronger level without needing to fill water bottles and go through the tedious steps to make awkward potions and add glowstone and such. They can also craft Mana Potions and Cooldown Potions.Blacksmiths use a Blacksmith's Anvil and a Blacksmith Hammer to repair any tool or weapon, as well as other classes tools required for crafting. They can also craft Rare Metal tools from Rare Metal ingots. Sword, Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel, and Shears. These tools all gain XP while using them and Level up granting them enchantments. A max level Raremetal Sword is unbreakable, has sweeping edge 3, Looting 3, and even causes Wither.Clothiers use a Clothier Station with Clean Cloth and Elemental Crystals to craft Mage Clothes, which are slightly better than Netherite and Highly enchantable. They can also craft Small Satchels that hold 10 Item Stacks. They can also craft Armour Repair kits that fully repair all worn Armour.Enchanters use a Enchanter Bench and a Book of Secrets to choose ANY enchant they want in the game at any level they choose! They can enchant any enchantable item other than RareMetal tools. They can also disenchant tools and armour into Enchanted books.Engineers use an Engineers Workbench to craft all the other workbenches for all the other professions. After a certain quest is finished, they can also craft the requirements for and the Base-in-a-Bottle which spawns a simple base anywhere the bottle is thrown.A Herbalist uses a Herbalist Station and a Pestle and Mortar to grind down plants found all over the world into other items. Mana grass into Ground Mana Grass required for Mana Potions, and certain plants will give you resources like redstone.A Merchant can use the Merchant Stall to sell items for CS(crystal shards). CS is the currency of WhitchCraft. This Class is automatically unlocked when you join the world.A Scholar uses a Scholar Shelf and Ancient Parchment to craft Scrolls with many different effects. One scroll even allows you to have creative flight for 20 seconds, another will summon a iron golem to save you. There are many others.Finally a Treasure Hunter is the only profession that can loot Crypts found all around the world. Crypts hold all the items you need for each profession, as well as resources and CS. Items found in the Crypts are needed for crafting and to complete Quests. There are 3 different Crypts, Basic, Intermediate, and Rare. Rare Crypts award the most loot and a little surprise inside the structure. Crypts also can award Mage XP if you prefer that over items.In the Welcome Book, there is information on the game, as well as Keybinds. If you haven't updated to V1.2.0+ On the last page there is a button \"Enable Singleplayer\" this must be pressed in order to play singleplayer. If not, you will not be able to obtain all the professions, and thus cannot finish all the quests. There is also a Reset Character button, if you press this you must click the Enable Singleplayer button after.Skills and XPEvery mob drops Mage XP orbs. Gaining enough Mage XP will grant you a Mage Level. Each Mage Level will give you either Skillpoints, or SpellPoints. SpellPoints are used to unlock your next spell in your element. Skillpoints are used for upgrading your passive stats in the Stats GUI. There is Mana Regen, Mana Level, Health Level, Health Regen, XP Multiplier, and Magic Dmg. Each is pretty self explanatory. I suggest upgrading Mana Level and Regen first, for you need more mana to cast higher level spells.QuestsSo far there are 19 Quests to complete, with quite a few advancements. Completing Quests is the main goal of WhitchCraft. They unlock many new features and abilities. Not to mention allow you to become more powerful. Currently if you finish the Necromage quests, you have beat the mod. But it won't be that easy. I'm sure it would take you a long time to aquire 64 Ender Eyes!BossesCurrently there is only 1 boss mob. The Flesh Golem. He is tough, and does a lot of damage. He has 2 phases. You will fight him in the Necromage Questline. I'm not an artist XDI am looking for feedback, let me know how you like WhitchCraft. We will go from there.https://ko-fi.com/undeadgmrdad Donations appreciated.", "Published time": "10/4/22 11:18 pm", "Views": 507, "Downloads": 52, "Credit": null, "Progress": "25% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.18.1", "Tags": "New Content, Crafting, Elemental, Magic, Upgrades, Wizard, Quests, Skills, Exploration, Spells, Spellcasting, Bossfight, Grind"},

These last 2 years were super busy and well, it is finally here. A LOT of things changed in this mod and a lot of new addons. We should probably start with the items. It is actually pretty much the same, except MORE STUFF. I have added other weapons that were not in the previous version (Gauntlet, Arm Guard ...). Also, a new crafting method for those. Now jumping into blocks, it is pretty much the same, except that I added the ores for the deepslate caves. I have also made them with an interesting design (I hope you like it). Other than the ores, new tables have been added to craft the mod items. Forge Station, Cast Table and the Enhancement Table (although this one is not working yet, I plan on fixing it in the next updates). Now, one of the big updates of this mod, ENTITIES!!! Enemy slimes, 2 bosses (Wendy and Ente) are now available and they do spawn in the world (in biomes or structures!). There are also 4 pets (Slime, Gon, Pepe and Kog B Mark 2). The are just like wolves. You tame them using Gems which can be obtained by planting its seeds (use JEI to check craftings). As I mentioned before, structures are also available now. There are also 8 new special ores that I have added (Note: They are NOT part of the game. I made them myself) and they will be used for crafting weapons and equipment. For now, only adventure equipment is craftable. I am still working on the roman and dolmen as well as making the other stuff. This was a very simple summary of what I added and I hope you enjoy it!

Ever wanted the creator of Minecraft to join you on your journeys? Well, look no further than the Miku and Friends mod! This mod adds Vocaloids to the game, as well as new items and a few new blocks to enrich your Minecraft Experience with Hatsune Miku and her friends! Do note that this is my first mod, so expect there to be some errors and kinks here and there.Currently, this mod contains the following:10 Vocaloid Entities, including Miku, Rin, Len, Luka, MEIKO, KAITO, GUMI, Gakupo, OLIVER, and Teto.  Vocaloids don't spawn naturally in the world, you need to craft a spawner to summon them! Generally, you'll need a Vocaloid Heart made up of 5 Note Blocks and the desired food for each Vocaloid, some Iron Ingots, an Iron Block, and a Jack-O-Lantern.  Vocaloids will roam around. They can be tamed with their desired food! Currently, there is no telling when they are tamed or not.  Vocaloids will either panic or attack when they are hit. (Depends on the Vocaloid)  Vocaloids will follow players who hold their desired food.  Vocaloids are tamable! Simply use their desired food to tame them!  Vocaloids are able to hold the Spring Onion Sword, a weapon made out of Spring Onions!New Foods, including Spring Onions, Bananas, Oranges, Tuna (Raw and Cooked), Rice, Rice Bowls, Onigiris, Sake, Popsicles, and Eggplants.A Banana Peel block exists (Obtained from eating Bananas), which makes the ground ultra slippery.The Magical Spring Onion lets any Vocaloid follow you just like their desired food! It's very expensive though, requiring three Emeralds, a Spring Onion, and a Nether Quartz.Music Discs! Vocaloids may drop special music discs containing remixes of your favorite Vocaloid Songs! Currently, there are 35 Music Discs in the mod right now.Vocaloid Props: You might be able to create props from Vocaloid songs, and use them for whatever you please!The Road Roller! This strong vehicle can crush blocks and other mobs!Hachune Miku is in the game as well, and is spawnable like any other Vocaloid. She is an aggressive and fast mob that gives out a handsome reward of a random Vocaloid Music Disc!The Crafting Recipies for this Mod can be all found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jkA7LPS6UErFEpqjiApC61hxfepCEvVqxC2UotEQ14I/edit?usp=sharing Anyways... I hope you enjoy this mod and feel free to ask me for some recommendations, additions, and changes! Have fun with Hatsune Miku!

Freddy and his friends have invaded your Minecraft world, and with them comes a whole slew of items, weapons, glitches, threats, and... wait, what?Defend yourself from powerful animatronic foes that lurk the dark corners of your blocky world. From freaky foxes that rush you down to unnerving ursine that get stronger as the fight goes on. Fight for your life as Freddy only grows stronger, struggle to outrun Foxy as he rushes you down, be beaten senseless as Bonnie teleports around you-- each animatronic will threaten you with something new and unique!If you're lucky, you might get some interesting drops. A suit, perhaps? Maybe a box of pizza that was probably meant to be delivered to your neighbor but was left at your door. You can take it, nobody will notice. Your neighbor can probably call in a mistake and get a free one. It's a win-win.Maybe take a break and build something nice. Set down your animatronics that you've gathered and decorate the walls with drawings, posters, and cries for help. Or you can spend an hour honking a poster. It's okay. I won't be mad.This is a personal project for me to both learn Minecraft modding, as well as to enjoy with friends. Updates may come quickly, updates may come slowly. I am constantly listening to suggestions and actively encourage them! All I want is to make something people enjoy.Latest Update: v3.3.5 - Halloween Hotfix3.3.5:- Fixes animatronics not spawning as they should.3.3.0:Small update for Halloween. Sorry! More will come soon!- The Shadows should be feared. Collecting Remnant after defeating Golden Freddy might prove dangerous; bring a Flashlight!- Flashlights have been entirely reworked! They have power now! You can re-charge them with...- Recharge Stations! Used to re-power your devices (currently only Flashlights.) Bring this little piece of the PizzaPlex home with just some Orange Concrete, Redstone, and a Redstone Lamp!- Frostbear is no longer lure exclusive and his items can no longer be crafted with snow. He now spawns in Cold biomes and has his own Frostbear Part drops for crafting his items.- Re-did all Lure recipes. Behavioral Synthesizers are now (currently) useless. Hang onto them tightly, however!- Rest in peace Timbo.- Fixed various bugs and made various improvements.I hope you enjoy what I have so far.", "Published time": "5/1/22 9:03 am", "Views": 11550, "Downloads": 3381, "Credit": "My good friend Jade for the animatronic and Freddy mask models.

If you decide to place the soul instead of using it for crafting, a Skully Soul mob will appear, but beware of them, they will fly towards you, passing through walls and everything in between, they will only stop if you put a skeleton skull in your head slot, making yourself invisible to them. Killing them is an easier way to get skeleton heads, since every time you do, you will get one of them.Gravestone: Crafted with smooth Andesite and the skelly heads you probably got from the Skully Soul mob, the gravestone is a great way to decorate your graveyards and pay respect to the dead! while only one design is craftable, the others can be obtained by using the stonecutter.Jars: Jars are used mainly as decorative/lightning block, but they can be used as storage too, since putting them into the crafting bench return the items used, with one condition, the empty jar will not be returned. Crafting one Jar gives you 3 back.There are 5 types of jars apart from the empty ones, they all are crafted the same way, by placing the jar and surrounding it with 8 items accordingly.Jar of Eyes: Crafted with Spider Eyes.Jar of Sugar: Crafted with Sugar.Jar of Souls: Crafted with Skully Souls.Head Jar: Crafted with one skull.Candle Jar: Crafted with one candle.Framed Paintings: These new 9 painting designs are perfect to decorate your haunted mansion, little cottage, or anything in between! are those eyes following me, or is it just me? the placement of these is random just like vanilla paintings, you can get a 1 block painting or a 2 block one.

{"Title": "Portals v2.0 (Paper Plugin)", "Description": "[ Portals v2.0 (Port) ]Portals 2.0 is a Paper plugin port of my datapack which adds portal structures to the game.The portals can travel anywhere in Minecraft and across dimensions. They don't naturally generate and you must craft the spawner to place a portal.Get the datapack here.[ Spawning and Despawning ]To craft a spawner, drop a diamond, end crystal, ender pearl and prismarine crystals atop a respawn anchor. You'll get a spawn egg to place down. The spawn egg displays the bounding box of the portal and will rotate depending on your rotation.To despawn a portal, place a tnt block on the DHD ( where the soul torch would go ) and confirm by pressing \"Yes\". The portal will be removed and all items (except for the diamond) will be returned.[ Using a Portal ]To activate a portal, place a soul torch on top of the center pillar. Once the torch slides into place, a keypad will open. Using the keypad, enter the ID of the target portal. Portal IDs are displayed above the center column upon activation. To get a list of all portal IDs, use the \"/listportals\" command. Once the ID is entered, press the blue symbol \"-=[@]=-\" at the bottom of the keypad. If the ID is valid, the portal will open. By default, portals are one-way (inbound connections show up as red). This can be changed in the config explained below.Note: You cannot dial yourself.[ Commands ]Below is a list of all commands for this plugin. Commands with a red asterisk \" *\" require an operator to execute* /givespawnegg - Gives the executer a portals spawn egg* /opentimeout - Sets or gets the time (in ticks) until a portal automatically closes* /primedtimeout - Sets or gets the time (in ticks) until a portal automatically un-primes* /keepoldportalframes - Sets or gets whether deleting a portal removes the structure* /updateportalids - Sets or gets whether removing a portal updates other portal IDs to remain synchronous* /showspawneggboundingbox - Sets or gets whether the spawn egg displays its bounding box* /allowduplex - Sets or gets whether two way portals are allowed* /opentimeoutpercent - Sets or gets the percentage of the open timeout a portal will stay open after passing through* /reloadportalstructures - Forcefully reloads all structures; removes any changes to them* /setportalid - Sets the ID of a portal (new ID must be available)* /dialportal - Attempts to open a connection between two portals* /closeportal - Attempts to close a portal* /lockportal - Locks one or more portals; locks all portals if no ID is supplied* /unlockportal - Unlocks one or more portals; unlocks all portals if no ID is supplied* /createportal - Creates a new portal at the set coordinates* /deleteportal - Deletes a portal with the specified ID/listportals - Lists all portals, their location, ID, state, and dimension* /portals2.0 - Opens the Portals plugin configuration manager[ Portal States ]Portals have a total of 7 different states, though only 6 matter.IDLE - The portal when idlePRIMED - The portal when a player inserted a soul torchOUTBOUND - The portal during an outbound connectionINBOUND - The portal during an inbound connectionBLOCKED - The portal if there are non passable blocks inside of the ringLOCKED - The portal when lockedSWITCHING - The portal when switching between the other 6 states[ Other Notes ]Inbound portals be default display with red particles. Entering the inbound side of a connection will result in your death (does not apply to creative players). This can be disabled by setting the \"allowduplex\" to true. Duplex portals will show green particles on the inbound side and will simply teleport you back to the dialing portal.All entities are capable of teleporting through the portals, just in case you have any pets. Just keep in mind that they will need to exit the event horizon before their cooldown wears off ( about 5 seconds ), in which case they might die.You can block a portal by placing a non-passable block inside of the inner ring. While blocked, the portal will not accept inbound connections and cannot make outbound connections. Locked portals will also refuse any connections.Any portal in the end will automatically lock if an ender dragon is present. Once the ender dragon is defeated, the portals will unlock.﻿For any issues or feedback, leave a comment below.", "Published time": "2/23/22 1:51 pm", "Views": 5418, "Downloads": 605, "Credit": null, "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.19.2", "Tags": "Portal, Minecraft, Server, Magic, Adventure, Plugin, Teleport, Dimensional, Technology, Teleporter, Portals, Scifi, Teleportation, Paper, Paperplugin, 118plugin"},

{"Title": "Better Respawn (The Death of Mindthemoods)", "Description": "A relatively simple mod, removes respawn functionality from beds; and adds respawn functionality to spawners; which can be collected, repaired, and charged with EXP to set a respawn point. (Importantly, this Mod replaces several Vanilla Achievements related to beds and respawn anchors with its own variants- if you want to make this work properly, you'll also need to install the provided datapack, which you can download here, on Mcreator)CHANGELOGBeds still skip the night, but no longer set the player’s respawn point. Sleeping no longer affects respawning in any way, and beds no longer explode in the Netherworld or End.Existing Respawn Anchors are removed from the game.Breaking any spawner now drops a ‘Broken Anchor,’ which can be repaired using iron and obsidian, to create a ‘Memory Anchor.’ Upon respawning from an anchor, the player is briefly inflicted with negative status effects, (but not as severely as a regular anchor.) Memory anchors have a 60% chance of deactivating when a player respawns by them. …This isn’t great, but respawning without an anchor gives a longer duration of these status effects.You can manually deactivate an anchor using an empty bottle, which yields a bottle o’ enchanting.If your anchor is broken or manually deactivated, you will still respawn there one more time before your respawn point becomes unbound.Using an anchor in the wrong dimension, or breaking a charged anchor causes it to explode, dropping experience orbs.Upgrade a Memory Anchor using Prismarine Shards and Crying Obsidian to create an 'Abzu Anchor,' which functions exclusively underwater, and grants a brief bit of Water breathing upon respawning, without most of the usual side effects. The Abzu anchor is also less likely to deactivate upon respawning.Requires nearby water or bubble columns to function.Upgrade a Memory Anchor using Ancient Debris and Crying Obsidian to create a 'Duat Anchor,' which functions exclusively in the Nether, and grants a brief bit of fire resistance upon respawning, without as much side effects.However, the Duat Anchor requires twice as much experience to charge, (a little under eight levels.)PLANNED ~ The 'Kronos Anchor,' made by upgrading a Duat Anchor with materials from the End, will function in the End dimension, and grant levitation upon respawning the player.TECHNICALWhen a player clicks on an activated respawn anchor, the following things happen:The block executes a spawnpoint command for the nearest player directly above it, if space is available. Otherwise, it checks the four adjacent blocks, and the blocks directly below it. If nothing works, the message “The anchor is obstructed” is given, and the spawnpoint is not set.The block sets three player-persistent number variables to the x, y, and z coordinates of the new spawnpoint.When a player respawns, but the respawn anchor has been subsequently broken or manually deactivated, (that is, if there isn’t a charged anchor nearby), their spawn point is reset to worldspawn, and the three number variables are each reset to zero.However, the anchor will function one last time if it has been broken, unless a new spawn point is set.Obstructing the anchor after a player is already bound to it does not reset their respawn points. (Use this knowledge as you will.)The message ‘Your Anchor is Broken or Unbound’ is recieved.If the player has never interacted with a respawn anchor, no message is recieved.Semi-randomized blindness, slowness, and weakness effects are applied.When a player clicks on a bed, the following things happen:If the number variables are at their default values, (that is, if the player either has not yet interacted with an anchor, or they respawn at a broken or disabled anchor), the spawn point is immediately reset to worldspawn.If the number variables are anything else, the spawnpoint is reset to there instead.Abzu anchors function a bit differently; they change a unique variable that determines whether or not the player is ‘Abzu Bound.’ This variable resets whenever a player interacts with another anchor, or the Abzu Anchor activates. They change the Bed variables as well, but do not set the spawnpoint.This is due to the fact that Minecraft considers spawnpoints obstructed by water and bubble columns. Instead, if a player respawns while bound to an Abzu Anchor, they are immediately teleported to its location, at which point the usual processes are run.ACHIVEMENTSStrange Dreams ~ Replaces 'Sweet Dreams,' and is obtained by successfully setting a respawn point using a Memory Anchor.Sister Location ~ Replaces 'Not Quite Nine Lives,' and is obtained by successfully setting a respawn point using a Duat Anchor.Adventuring Time ~ Slightly modified child advancement of Strange Dreams; now requires that all biomes be explored; on foot.

He lives in a small apartment in New Belgrade, but in recent videos, he has been visiting an unknown family on the countryside, presumed to be his relatives. Some of the consequences of being poor are clearly seen in his videos: The bad shape of his apartment, furniture and electronics, his notable missing teeth (which he is famous for) and in a lot of videos, he tends to complain how he can't afford certain foods. Kale is also a member of a public kitchen, where he gathers lots of his food.Most of Kale's videos depict him with headphones, recording himself and singing loudly in public (usually on the streets or in buses). He causes lots of surrounding people to either get mad at him, or burst out laughing. He sometimes bothers people with nonsensical questions and maniacal laughing, and he also often chants random phrases in a gruff voice, always ending with his well-known \"Ale, ale!\".The exact purpose of Kale's channel is not known. People in the comments of his videos are divided in groups. Some people think that Kale knows that he is poor, and he acts like this to keep himself and the people around him happy and entertained. Others believe that Kale is just purposely annoying people, and they often leave insults in his comment section. There is also a small amount of people that think that Kale is mentally ill, however, this has not been proven.It is also worth mentioning that, apart from singing in public and chanting food names, Kale also has a mini-series on his channel called Kale's Kitchen (or Kale Kičen as he writes). This series consists of 30-second to 3-minute videos of him preparing various meals for himself.Some of the most popular Kale's quotes:Život je kratak, pojedi batak. - (rough translation) Life is short, eat a chicken thigh.Jedi boraniju, brateuuuu. - (rough translation) Eat green beans brotherrrr.Derem se jer se branim, branim se svojim glasom - (rough translation) I am yelling cuz i am defending myself, i am defending myself with my voice", "Published time": "10/24/22 7:36 pm", "Views": 212, "Downloads": 11, "Credit": null, "Progress": "40% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.18", "Tags": "Other"},

{"Title": "Spawn Eggs Craftings", "Description": "so...yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesYou may have heard that the longest word in the world is antidisestablishmentarianism. This 28-letter word, which is the name of a movement in 19th century England against the disestablishment of the Church of England, sure is a mouthful. Gleeful middle schoolers love to say it because once you know this word, you must truly have mastered the language.There’s just one problem: it’s not the longest word. No one is quite sure where it started, but the idea of antidisestablishmentarianism being the longest word is a linguistic myth. So what is the longest word?Well, that question causes some trouble. The fact is that many languages are agglutinative. That means words can be created by just jamming other, smaller words together. A famous example of this is German, which has a reputation for having words for everything. The official longest German word at 63 letters used to be the name of a beef label law: Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz. The law went away in 2013, however, and this word was struck from the books.Because German words can be made by mashing smaller words together, they can technically stretch to infinity. And German isn’t alone in this (nor is it even the most impressive); languages including Finnish, Estonian and English can all produce words that are infinitely long. Therefore, the longest word is infinitely long. Case closed.Still here? OK, fine, that’s kind of cheating. There must be impressively long words that actually exist.

{"Title": "Biome Improvement (Mindthemood's Pile of Rocks", "Description": "Especially in Java Edition, biomes can seem a little barren. Forests have trees, occasional flower patches, and little else. Plains have a similar lack of variety. This (relatively simple) mod aims to change all that, by adding a variety of new details to various environments, while only adding a single new block to the game. Overall, it is intended to be an extremely vanilla-friendly way of improving existing biomes without adding an excess of new features; expect to see plenty of stumps, new and fallen tree variants, and quite a lot of rocks.Raid Spider Nests for some half-decent prizes in Dark Forests, and be on the look out for Large Bee Nests in plains, birch forests, and flower forests- these structures always contain a rare, Royal Honey block; which grants absorption in increasing duration and potency based on nearby flowering blocks and beehive blocks. Royal Honey cannot be collected when broken, so be sure to plan your operations accordingly. When maxed out, a Royal Honey can grant fourteen minutes of doubled health, for those patient enough to locate and tend a hive.CHANGELOGNests are the largest variety of features added by the mod. (They’re still rarely larger than a regular dungeon.) Spider Nests can be found mostly buried in dark forests, and feature, (you guessed it), spiders, as well as a small bit of pilfered loot if you’re willing to fend them off.Bee Nests, on the other hand, are a larger, rarer variety of hive that can be found partly buried in birch forests, plains, and most commonly in flower forests. (They’re fairly rare.) Each Nest contains the single new block added by the mod, and let me just say, it’s pretty interesting as far as blocks go…Royal Honey is a fairly rare new block, and a variant of regular honey. Only one can be found in each Bee Nest, making the stuff a bit of a hot commodity. It can be broken, but cannot be picked up or moved.Standing on royal honey gradually grants a long lasting absorption effect to the player. The duration of the effect ranges from four to fourteen minutes, and is based on the number of beehives or nests within a 5*5 cube around the block. The potency of the effect ranges from two to ten absorption hearts, and is based on the number of flowers or flowering blocks nearby.If you’re patient, careful, and willing to tend quite a lot of flowers, you can double your health bar for a solid fourteen minutes using maxed out Royal Honey- however, since it can only be found in the nests, you’ll have to plan your operations accordingly!Forests can now feature the following:Small patches of podzol, coarse dirt, and (more rarely), rooted dirt.Oak Stumps and fallen Oak Logs; and rarer mushroom variants of each.Occasional ferns, and (slightly) more short grass.Single Granite and Stone blocks can be found scattered on slopes.Larger Rocks made of Granite, Stone, and bits of Copper Ore can be found throughout.Special ‘Old’ variants of normal and fancy oak trees, featuring vines and mushrooms adorning them.Birch Forests can now feature the following:Various Birch Stumps and Fallen Birch Logs; with rarer Glow-Lichen variants. (These are more common in old growth forests.)More flowers, (specifically Azure Bluelets, Alliums, and Lilies).Occasional patches of Lilacs and Peonies with coarse dirt beneath them.Single Stone and Andesite blocks scattered on slopes.Occasional stone and andesite rocks, with larger glow-lichen variants unique to old-growth birch forests.Patches of Gravel and (more rarely), rooted dirt throughout.Spruce Forests can now feature the following:Various Spruce Stumps and Fallen Spruce Logs; with rarer variants adorned with moss and mushrooms.Single Mossy Cobblestone blocks scattered on slopes.Smaller Mossy Cobblestone rocks in regular Spruce Forests.Occasional patches of younger Sweet Berry bushes in all Spruce Biomes.Large Stumps and Large Fallen Logs (2*2), in both variants of Old-growth Taiga.Small patches of Podzol, as well as Moss Carpets and Mushrooms in all varieties of spruce forests.Smaller Spruce Shrubs in both variants of Old-growth Taiga.Dark Forests can now feature the following:Patches of mycelium and fungus can be found scattered throughout, as can smaller mushroom trees.Deepslate and Tuff rocks and boulders can be found throughout the biome, and can generate infested with Silverfish. (Just in case building here wasn’t enough of a nuisance.)Giant Dark Oak Stumps and a Giant variant of Dark Oak trees can generate, featuring an enormous double canopy, mushrooms, and cobwebs. (Perfect for a treehouse, if you’re especially daring.)Oceans can now feature the following:Small bits of prismarine can be found in nearly any body of water, with larger patches and rocks being unique to regular oceans. In deep oceans, boulders with prismarine and sea lanterns can generate.Lukewarm oceans feature patches of moss, and rocks/boulders made from sand and smooth sandstone.Cold oceans feature spikey, stoney boulders, and occasional small bits of packed ice.Frozen oceans and rivers feature patches and spikes of packed and regular ice.Deserts can now feature the following:Occasional smooth-sandstone and sandy rocks.Savannahs & Mesas can now feature the following:Infrequent Acacia StumpsRare larger Acacia trees (Only in Savannahs)Grassy, striped Terracotta BouldersMushroom Isles can now feature the following:Smaller patches of mushrooms and mushroom blocksSmall mushrooms and small Mushroom TreesRarer giant variants of both Mushroom TreesLarge patches of Coarse DirtCaves can now feature the following:Medium Patches of Dripstone and Pointed Dripstone on the floors and ceilings of regular caves.Rare mushrooms and mushroom/mycelium patches.Fairly common patches of CobwebsSmall Azalea Bushes (In and around Lush Caves)Patches of Moss surrounding Shroomlights (In and around Lush Caves)Smaller Geodes can be found underground with a block or two of amethyst or budding amethyst inside.Cold Biomes, (Including the Grove, Tundra, and Snowy Taiga), now feature:Ice and Packed Ice rocks and boulders.Snowy Spruce Stumps & ShrubsThe Nether now boasts the following:A couple additional bone fragments in Soul Sand ValleysOccasional Wither Roses on Soul Sand or SoilPatches of spikey Basalt and Blackstone rocks in the lower parts of the Nether.Small Nether Geodes, made from Smooth Basalt and Blackstone, with Quartz and Smooth Quartz blocks inside.Occasional Mushroom and Mycelium patches- (the only way of obtaining naturally generated dirt in the Nether.)ACHIVEMENTSGenuine Royalty ~ Get the full ten heart boost from a block of royal honey.STRATEGYNests are relatively easy to raid, especially as they can be lit up simply by removing any canopy above them- better yet, the spiders can have a tricky time actually getting out. However, do not fall into one blindly, especially in the middle of the night, when they're more of an issue. Bear in mind that these are relatively common, and are more of a nuisance to remove than anything else, as they're liable to just keep accumulating spiders if you don't keep moving. ...However, all those spawners may prove a welcome reward, if you're willing to go through the trouble of clearing them.Flowering Azalea blocks are the best way to boost Royal Honey as they can be placed anywhere, unlike regular flowers. (Apple Blossoms will also work if you've got Cooking with Mindthemoods installed.) Keep in mind that while it takes a fair bit of flowering blocks to increase the level of absorption, every beehive you place will give an additional thirty seconds of absorption; up to fourteen minutes, making them a bit more helpful. ...Also, try to be careful, as the block itself isn't too hard to break by accident, inflicting a nasty poison effect.If it's Wood Blocks (instead of logs) you're after, a lot of the larger trees utilize them for their roots and branches. Similarly, rooted dirt, prismarine, and glow lichen can all be obtained a bit more easily in small quantities thanks to certain new biome features.Lastly, if you really need dirt in the Nether for some reason, mushroom patches provide a renewable, (albeit fairly rare) source.TECHNICAL…Technically, the bit about not adding any blocks isn’t entirely true. Mushrooms have weird light requirements, and would often break if a structure involving them generated without the proper light conditions. As such, many structures use a ‘fake’ mushroom block that resembles a regular one, without any light requirements. (They’re otherwise identical, dropping normal mushrooms when broken.) However, if you’re using resource packs, (Stay True, for example, adds improved, variated versions of fungi), this could be a bit annoying. Once again, if there’s sufficient, (or any) demand, I can release another version without this ‘feature.’Predictably, there are a couple known issues so far that don’t have an especially easy solution. They are as follows:Rarely, small mushroom and moss patches can generate on slopes in spruce forests with a single block of air beneath them. (Short of writing a very specific generation condition for all 15 different variants, this will happen on rare occasions.)The Stone components of certain rock structures can be replaced with ores or other rock types (and occasionally dirt) if a vein of said material generates directly below it. (I haven’t really had issues with this, and it actually adds a bit more variation to existing rocks.)Custom biome features can spill slightly into other biomes- personally, I consider this more of an ‘unexpected feature’ than a problem. However, for certain features, I’ve added more specific base requirments. (Such as sand rocks in deserts, and stony rocks on stone; or water features requiring… water. In addition to biome requirements.)Lush Cave features, (specifically the small Azalea bushes), can on rare occasions generate with some air beneath them if they generate on a very steep slope. (This could be fixed pretty easily, but I’ve only every seen it happen once after multiple hours of testing. May still get to it later.)Some structures, (Such as the large dark oak trees, snowy shrubs, and tall birch trees) could use a couple more variants. Again, not a large issue, (and my playtester didn’t notice it), but I might still add a couple more anyways.Old Oak trees with hanging vines can very rarely generate intersecting with another structure in such a way that it leaves a single floating vine block.HIGHLIGHTSThe Forest is and remains my favorite biome to have worked on, at least in part because it was the first biome I tackled, and in no small measure thanks to the fact that it really needed improving. Really, I just like how it turned out in general, And could now conceive of actually enjoying exploring such a common biome.The Mushroom Fields, oddly enough, were by far the most time consuming biome. Despite the fact that I have yet to actually find one more than once in survival Minecraft, I really like the concept, and spent far too much time finnicking over the generation to get it just right- not to mention making more variants of the Giant Mushroom Trees than any of the more common ones players might encounter. ...That being said, I think it paid off. I can at least hope the Mooshrooms appreciate my efforts, if no one else....And last but certainly least, the Cave Features were the most frustrating part of the whole endeavour- when Minecraft tries to place structures underground, it randomly selects from any block in the chunk, meaning you have to make dozens of duplicates of a structure to give it even a small chance of finding the right generation conditions. What's more, the Lush caves gave me no end to grief. ...Still, I think the caves are at least passably better, if not nearly as fantastic as I would have hoped.", "Published time": "6/26/22 5:52 pm", "Views": 1069, "Downloads": 82, "Credit": null, "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.19.2", "Tags": "Plants, Trees, Biome, Worldgen, Rocks, Other, Detail"},

{"Title": "insomnia-tower-defense", "Description": "Tower defence- Our top product hereInsomnia Tower defense is a story mode game where you battle over 50 waves of creatures using... Towers? Yes! You yourself can't do anything, but with a wide range of towers, 2 levels, four difficulties, 5 money settings, 5 advanced settings, over 20 total towers, and awesome maps, why wouldn't you want to play? Why is it our top product though? Well, with over a year of work underneath this game's belt, and almost entirely vanilla gameplay, and great ratings from our beta testers, we decided to nominate it as our best product! It was so good, the team downloaded the game for themselves, just to try to defeat it in the hardest difficulty!Alright, what does the game contain?To start off, let's talk about the settings. When you first join, if you look behind you, a settings billboard will appear. Just by simply punching the center of the sign, you can modify each setting. The settings it was set to are what is recommended, but you can change it up to whatever you want! The first setting- (difficulty) modifies the hp and damage dealt by each of the mobs in-game. With every setting, their hp DOUBLES, and their damage increases by 50%The second setting- (starting cash) modifies how much money you start off with. For the best experience, the lowest setting is you recommended if you want a real challenge, but one or two settings above works well on harder difficulties. The third setting- (cash conserve) decides how much cash will be saved when the round is over. If you don't want your hard work to go to waste, or if you want to get billions of dollars, this setting is for you. It's recommended to be disabled for the best experience!Before starting, one other thing is important to understand: Level selection. You can press the previous and next buttons to choose levels, but you must defeat the current level in order to unlock the next!Once your level is selected and settings optimized, you can either wait for your friends to join (yes it's multiplayer). Or you can go solo and be the best tower defender ever!(Walk into the portal blocks and wait 5 seconds)Great! Now that you're in the level, your inventory will have one thing: A trident. Throw the trident to start the level. Wait! Before you do that, press the nearby salesman and purchase some towers. Archer towers and barracks! Take the item and throw it directly on the gold block. Once placed, they can be removed with TNT (drop the TNT). You can upgrade towers by throwing books at them, where you will be taken to a special upgrade room. Choose the green options, and read the books underneath to see what they do! (These features are unlocked when the level starts)One last thing- These towers cost money to both upgrade and build. In order to get money, sell mob drops that you get from killed enemies!Gameplay- Now that everything is set, get ready! Mobs will spawn from the green emerald blocks, and come in waves. They will follow the given path and try to make it to the end. The end has Redstone blocks. If they make it there, they will vanish and you will lose a percentage of your hp! There are 10 rounds, and each round has 5 waves. You will get a small break in between waves to sell your loot and upgrade/spawn towers. Use that time wisely, and get the best towers there is!The game ends either when you run out of lives, or the last mob from the last wave is defeated. You will be taken back to the hub and the next level will be unlocked. New levels have new mobs!Other info-The expected playtime per level is 30 min ~ hour. Try all the difficulties, and play with friends for the best experience!You can also try sandbox mode (give yourself a lot of cash)You can't attack mobsMobs can't attack youEverything here except for the mob size uses commands!You can't destroy the worldSelect version for changelog:1.0.2ChangelogFixed bug were you would spawn in level that has yet to be reviled.Small bug fixes.Fixed crashing issue on mobile certain mobile devices.InstallationWhen installing this world, first press the download button (not zip), which takes you to the full download site, with all the features listed above, as well as a quick download.Assuming you pressed the download button, wait 6 seconds for the top right corner to say \"skip\".

{"Title": "Foods & Plants (Cooking with Mindthemoods)", "Description": "Minecraft has more than enough foods to begin with- what it lacks are proper meals, or, say, any incentive to eat something other than steak or golden carrots. This mod adds a new system with which to make meals out of various ingredients, which have chances of granting special status effects. In addition, players can gain a special new status effect by eating a more diverse array of foods, or be inflicted with a new negative status effect by eating the same foods over and over again.In addition to meals and the new nutrition system, players can now harvest and farm apples using apple blossom blocks, which can be found in apple trees and bushes in certain biomes. Players can harvest rice from rivers and swamps, and can make cheese by smelting milk, which can be aged to increase its potency.This is my first proper mod- and while I’ve got quite a few ideas, I wanted to begin by trying something that would necessitate a lot of different skills to make. I’m pretty pleased with the end result, and excited to work on more ideas, with the end goal of making a Vanilla+ style modpack.Now includes compatibility for ﻿Mindthemood's Ashen Remains!CHANGELOGThe Cooking Table can be crafted using four of any planks, and two leather. It has the appearance of jungle wood, and can be used to turn basic ingredients into meals. Place main ingredients in the three slots to the left, and a base ingredient into the middle slot. (Such as a bowl, milk bucket, bread, stick, or bottle.)The Cooking table can hold ingredients, and can be filled using hoppers. It cannot, however, automatically prepare food. (Partly for coding reasons, and partly because I want players interaction to be a necessity for making this stuff.)If you have the base ingredient for a recipe, but not the main ingredients, an empty slot will appear around the menu. If you have most of the ingredients you need to make something, images of available recipes appear around the menu.Some existing recipes have been changed to exclusively go with the cooking table.~~~Chocolate can be prepared using cocoa beans, sugar, and milk. It doesn’t refill any hunger, but refills saturation, and can be eaten at any time. (Though eating a bunch of it might eventually make you sick.)~~~Apple Blossoms are a new way to more reliably obtain apples. Apple trees can generate naturally in regular forest biomes, and have some of their leaves replaced with a blossom variant. When fully mature, apple blossoms can be harvested with a shear, dropping 2-3 apples without destroying the block. With fortune, they drop 2-6.When mined with Silk Touch, any variety of apple blossom drops the basic apple blossom block, allowing you to move them around for easier farming. Just make sure they’re near wood!Apple bushes can be found in flower forests and sparse jungles; Apple trees can occasionally be found in regular forests. Both consist of regular oak trees with rooted dirt and apple blossom blocks.~You can harvest apple blossoms automatically using a dispenser with shears.Apple trees can only be found naturally generating, so be careful with the blossoms you find. (However, you’ll only ever get a single apple through this method.)This is compatible with Motschen’s Better leaves, if your resource pack involves bushy leaves.~~~Rice is a new variety of crop. You can find young rice plants in rivers, and mature rice plants in swamps. (And eventually mangrove swamps, when 1.19 rolls out.)Small rice plants will only grow to maturity if bonemeal is applied by a player.Once mature, rice plants can no longer be bonemealed. They go through three growth stages, (over the course of at least 10 minutes), at the end of which they can be harvested using a hoe, dropping 4-8 rice. (4-12 with any level of fortune.)Rice isn’t edible on its own, but eight rice and one honey bottle can be used to make Sticky Rice. Sticky rice can be eaten as is, or used to make sushi.Rice must be planted in at least one block of water. Once fully grown it can survive out of water, but will only grow if at least the bottom half is waterlogged.As if swamps weren’t annoying enough to travel through, rice plants slow down anything that moves through them horizontally.~~~Cheeses are special food items that can be placed in the world like cake- use a furnace or a smoker to turn a bucket of milk into a bucket of cheese, which you can then place as a cheese wheel, and break to get 3 cheese slices, (4, if you’ve got fortune), or use silk touch to pick the cheese wheel back up.Cheese removes negative status effects when eaten.Cheese Wheels age over time- cheese can become Aged Cheese, which is more filling, and increases the duration of positive status effects in addition to removing negative ones. Aged Cheese can even become Ancient Cheese, which is even more filling, and increases both the duration and potency of positive status effects, as well removing negative ones.…However, don’t let cheese age too long, or it’ll become moldy. Moldy cheese has, shall we say, far less helpful properties, if you choose to eat it. Also try to avoid letting anything stomp on your cheeses…Cheese does not age if exposed to the sky, or if waxed with honeycomb. (Wax is removed whenever a cheese wheel is broken or picked up.) Unless waxed, cheese breaks when submerged or unsupported.Four cheese slices can be reassembled into a cheese wheel of their corresponding type. (If, say, you don’t want to waste Silk Touch on cheese wheels.)~~~Meals are special food items that fill more hunger and saturation than most regular foods, and have the added bonus of occasionally bestowing positive status effects based on their ingredients (After you’ve had a bit of time to digest them, of course.) Some meals have multiple levels based on the quality and quantity of ingredients used, which are visually different from their lower level counterparts; most require different ingredients from a certain food group.Sweet Bread is made using sweet berries and bread- it isn’t that filling, but has a chance of granting absorption.Whole-Grain Bread can be made by combining rice with bread. It’s more filling than regular bread, but can’t be used in other recipes.Sticky Bread is made using honey and bread. It’s fairly filling, and incredibly sweet- it also removes poison.Chocolate Bread is made using chocolate or cocoa beans and bread. It’s not the healthiest thing ever, but has a chance of granting speed.Carrot Bread is made using carrots and bread. It has a chance of granting Night Vision.Meat Sandwiches are made using bread and meat. Has a chance of granting Strength.Veggie Sandwiches are made using bread and vegetables. Has a chance of granting Resistance.Fish Sandwiches are made using bread and fish. Higher levels have a chance of granting Dolphin’s Grace.Rotten Sandwiches are made using bread and… less than advisable ingredients. Probably best not to eat this.Grilled Cheese can be made using bread and cheese. It doesn’t belong to any one food group, and doesn’t affect nutrition.Tasty Sandwiches can be made using a combination of vegetables, meat, and cheese on bread. They automatically increase nutrition without belonging to any one food group.Beef Stew is made exclusively with beef. It is extremely filling, and has a chance of granting strength.Syrup is made using honey and sugar. It removes poison, and is quite filling, but far from a healthy choice.Simmered Fruit is made using various fruits. It has a decent chance of granting absorption.Mushroom Stew now requires three mushrooms, but can be made using three of any overworld mushroom.Beetroot Soup now only requires three beetroot to make, and is thus a bit more of a plausible source of food. …Still not great though.Potato Soup is made using cheese and potatoes. It removes negative status effects, and can also grant fortitude.Suspicious Stew retains the same recipes, but is now made with the cooking table. Suspicious stews now have visual differences based on which flower is used to make them.Rabbit Stew is now made using a normal potato, a carrot, and a cooked rabbit.Strange Soup is made using chorus fruit, and teleports the player directly upwards.Meat Skewers are made with meat- they’re faster to eat than other meat- type meals, and moderately filling, with a small chance of granting strength.Veggie Skewers are made with vegetables- they’re faster to eat than other veggie type meals, and have a small chance of granting fortitude.Fish Skewers are made with, (you guessed it), Fish. They’re fast to eat, and have a small chance of granting Dolphin’s Grace.Fruit Skewers are fast to eat, and have a small chance of granting absorption.Suspicious Skewers are made using fungi. They’re fairly fast to eat, and grant a randomly selected status effect for a short duration when eaten.Strange Skewers are made using chorus fruit. They teleport the player directly downwards if space is available.Rotten Skewers are made using more dubious ingredients. They inflict nausea when eaten.Pumpkin Pie is now made using a pumpkin, eggs, sugar, and wheat in the main slot. It can be placed into the world as a cake-like object. Up to five pumpkin pies can be placed on one block.Melon Tarts are a pumpkin pie alternative made using melons in place of pumpkins. They too can be placed up to five per block.Apple Crisps are a pumpkin pie alternative made using apples. They’re slightly more filling, and can be placed up to five per block.A Chicken Dinner can be made using three vegetables, and a chicken. It’s extremely filling.A Loaded Potato can be made by combining cheese with a baked potato. They remove negative status effects and increase positive status effects.A Fiery Filet can be made using netherworld fungi, and ham. It’s quite filling, and can grant fire resistance.Stuffed Mushrooms can be made using cheese and fungi. They remove negative status effects, and increase the duration of positive status effects.Hard Candy can be made using berries, honey, and sugar. What they lack in nutrition, they make up for with serious saturation.A Seafood Dinner can be made using kelp, sea pickles, and any fish. It can grant water breathing.Sushi can be made using sticky rice and dried kelp- doing so makes a three-sushi item. Sushi can be eaten three times, (which visually changes the item), is fairly filling, and most importantly, can be eaten very quickly.Veggie Sushi is a less filling sushi variant that has a chance of granting Resistance.Fish Sushi is a less filling sushi variant that has a chance of granting Dolphin’s Grace.~~~Condiments are special, bottled food items that are fairly useless on their own, but can be held in the offhand while eating to provide special status effects to foods that wouldn’t normally have them.Sweet Berry Jam is made using sweet berries and sugar. It can grant absorption to foods that go well with jam.Savory Sauce is made using nether fungus and honey. It can grant regen to foods that go well with sauce. (Meats, primarily.)Spicy Hummus is made using normal fungus and an egg. It can grant strength to foods that go well with hummus. (Veggies, mostly.)Chocolate Sauce is made using chocolate. It can grant speed to foods that go well with chocolate sauce. (Which does not include steak, you weirdo.)Dill Relish is made using sea pickles. It can grant Dolphin’s grace to seafoods.~~~Finally, Nutrition is a system through which the player can gain special benefits, or penalties, depending on the foods they eat.Most foods are grouped into five categories- fruits, vegetables, meats, sweets, and fish. Some foods don’t go with any food group, and thus don’t affect nutrition. (Specifically, bread and cheese.) They still, however, will count for the last few foods you’ve eaten.Nutrition goes up when the last three foods you’ve eaten are all from different food groups. Similarly, it goes down if the last three foods you’ve eaten are all from the same food group.When nutrition is low, and continues to drop, the player may be inflicted with Pallor, a status effect that increases the amount of damage the player is dealt, and decreases saturation whenever the player is hurt. The strength of the effect depends on how low nutrition is, while the duration depends on the potency of the food you just ate. Worse still, you won’t be able to get positive status effects from other foods if your nutrition is low.When nutrition is high, and continues to go up, you can get a special status effect, (Vigor), which does the exact opposite of Pallor- restoring a certain amount of hearts whenever the player takes damage while below 14 health. Once again, its strength depends on how high nutrition is, and its potency depends on the food you’ve just eaten.When you eat food that increases nutrition, listen for a chiming sound- conversely, if you hear a slimy sound, odds are whatever you just ate decreased nutrition.Sleeping causes nutrition to go a bit closer to neutral, and death resets it entirely.ACHIVEMENTSCooking ~ Craft a cooking table using wooden planks and leather. (Husbandry)Cheesy ~ Age cheese in order to increase its potency (Husbandry)Condiments ~ Use a condiment in your offhand slot to improve your food. (Husbandry)Cheese the Dragon ~ Defeat the Ender Dragon exclusively using a hunk of cheese. (End)STRATEGYThere are a couple of different strategies players can use to deal with nutrition, (or at least a couple I and my playtesters playtester found myself gravitating towards), with varying levels of success:Ignorance ~ If you flat out ignore the nutrition system, and make a constant effort to, say, eat exclusively golden carrots, you’ll quickly feel the effects of Pallor- however, if you use cheese to remove Pallor whenever it sets in, you’ll still be relatively unaffected. (However, you won’t ever be able to get any positive status effects from other foods.) Nonetheless, this is a viable option.Neutral ~ …Though if you’re going to eat only one food, you might be better off using something less potent. Neither bread nor cheese affects nutrition- however, both of them are a bit of a pain to make. On a strict diet of bread and cheeses, you won’t ever get Vigor or Pallor, and you’ll still be able to get positive status effects from food. (Keep in mind that while cheese is exempt from nutrition, bread counts as a food you’ve eaten, but not as any particular food group.Half Decent ~ If you do make a habit of paying attention to nutrition, (or at the very least, cycling through three different food sources, and making sure to end on a food of high potency to grant you the maximum duration of vigor), you’ll be able to get a variety of positive effects, even if it can be a bit of a hassle to get enough different foods at any given time. (Especially since you can’t just farm crops or meat.) Personally, I found melons, carrots, and steak to be the easiest to farm in large quantities; and fishing proved to be a welcome source of relief whenever I was worried about eating too much of any one thing.~~~…However, if you really wanted to play the system, and guarantee Vigor III and decent status effects whenever you eat food, my recommendation is the following:Set up a cow farm, chicken farm (for the eggs, not the chickens), carrot farm, wheat farm, gold farm (optional), and berry farm.When you’re done with that, (if you’re really determined), use a hopper system to load and unload your cooking table with the ingredients you need. (It can be really annoying to move smallish stacks of food around if you’re in a hurry.)Eat a rotating diet of Meat Sandwiches, Veggie Sandwiches, and Sweetbread/Chocolate Bread/Fish Sandwich depending on whether you want absorption, speed, or dolphin’s grace.Use the higher, non-stackable versions of foods when you have the time or space; otherwise, use the lower-level varieties. (If you’re up for it, put a hopper under the cooking table and use it to fill shulkers for lunch-boxes.)Always wait until your hunger is at least four shanks down to eat, as all of the foods you’ll be eating restore at least eight hunger.Use chocolate after eating to increase saturation, and ancient cheese whenever you get a status effect to boost its duration and potency.If you’re going to sleep, wait to eat until you wake up. Sleeping always brings nutrition closer to zero, especially if it’s fairly high; waiting until the morning will guarantee you can keep it at the desired level.~~~And some additional notes:Tasty Sandwiches can be made using any vegetable, a meat or fish, and cheese or a fried egg. The ingredients used do not affect the outcome, (a 4.5 shank, non-stackable meal that always increases nutrition), and the most efficient way is to use beetroot, basic cheese, and raw fish. …Not the most appetizing, admittedly.Getting a reliable supply of bread is important if you want to be able to make the various sandwiches the mod has to offer- which is a bit annoying now that bread requires eggs and milk.Don’t eat raw bread! It’s not worth it for the number of ingredients you need to make it- especially when it can be used for sandwiches, and other renewable food sources do just as well. Whole-grain bread is a little better, but still a bit of a waste when you could be making sandwiches.Skewers are great if you have a lot of any given food, and access to sticks. (That is, basically anywhere.) However, for all their convenience, they do use up a lot of ingredients for low returns. Good in a pinch though.If you really don’t want to pay any heed to nutrition, a steady diet of plain sushi is the way to go. (Also, why did you download this mod?) It’s easy to carry around, moderately filling, and can be eaten very quickly in a pinch.TECHNICALFood items have varying chances of actually granting status effects, ranging from usually around 30% for small food items, and 60% for large food items, which also grant higher levels.~~~Suspicious Stews now randomly grant either a specific positive status effect, or a random negative status effect based on the current phase of the moon. Levitation is granted as a negative status effect if the moon is full. They only grant their positive effect if nutrition is above a certain, randomly selected level.~~~The Rice shoots, Young Rice plant, and various stages of the bottom and top segment of the rice plant are all separate, waterloggable blocks. Mature rice plants can technically survive out of water, but do not grow this way naturally, and cannot be planted like this in survival. Rice growth is based on random ticks, and each stage has a forced two minute delay once ticked.All varieties of naturally occurring rice plant are technically structures rather than biome features, in order to ensure a waterlogged state. They exclusively generate between y60-63, must be waterlogged, and must grow on dirt, rooted dirt, either type of sand, soul sand, or clay- if the selected block is dirt, the dirt is replaced with rooted dirt. Tall rice plants only generate if their top block is in air, and their bottom block is a water source.~~~Apple blossom trees are modified variants of existing oak trees, and can generate, (in order of frequency), in small, medium, and large variants. They exclusively occur in regular forests, check that flat ground is available, and replace an area of ground below them with rooted dirt. Like rice plants, they are saved as structures in-game, with an area of air below to replace existing trees that they generate near.Apple Blossoms take at least fifteen minutes to fully mature.Mature Apple Blossoms prevent block placement when targeting them unless the player is shift clicking. (This is a side effect of checking if the player is using a hoe to harvest the block.)Apple Blossoms can be harvested by a dispenser with shears on any side, causing an apple to drop off on the opposite side of the dispenser doing the harvesting.~~~Cheese aging occurs based on random ticks with roughly the same likelihood as copper. Once a regular cheese wheel decides to age, it waits an additional 20 minutes before doing so. This duration is increased to 40 minutes for aged cheese to become ancient, and 10 minutes for ancient cheese to become moldy. Cheese aging can be observed- however, cheese does not drop when broken by anything other than the player. It could still be automated to some extent. (You could design a system, for example, which exposes cheese to the sky once it becomes ancient.)~~~Nutrition ranges from -24 to positive 24, and cannot go higher or lower- it resets on death, and goes two levels closer to zero whenever the player sleeps. (Four levels if nutrition is below -16 or above 16.) The game saves the food groups of the last two foods the player has eaten, and when the player eats, decreases nutrition by one if all three of the foods are from the same food group, and increases nutrition by one if none of them are from the same food group.Food groups, (neutral, fruit, veggie, meat, sweet, and fish), are saved as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.Some foods have special behaviors- decreasing/increasing nutrition by set amounts. Others, (such as Gapples), have extra-high potencies that decrease nutrition by more than usual if the player has eaten a lot of them.On death, the last two foods the player has eaten are both set to neutral.~~~The ‘Cheese the Dragon’ achievement is, ironically, fairly difficult to cheese! The procedure for the achievement checks how many times the player has attacked the dragon with a cheese item before the dragon is killed, and resets if the player uses anything other than a cheese item. The dragon has to have been attacked with cheese at least thirty times without any other items being used afterwards for the achievement to trigger.~~~Cooking with Mindthemoods isn’t compatible with other food mods, as far as I know. (Largely because it adds several unique systems.) However, if you want to add your own foods to it and have them compatible with existing mechanics, you can use the following:To make foods compatible with different condiments, use the ‘forge’ tags ‘sauce_flavor,’ ‘dill_flavor,’ ‘humus_flavor,’ ‘jam_flavor’ and ‘chocolate_flavor’ respectively.To add your own food items that affect nutrition, use the ‘forge’ tags ‘is_meat,’ ‘is_fruit,’ ‘is_veggie,’ ‘is_sweet,’ or ‘is_fish.’ Bear in mind these tags are also used for meals where any food from a certain food group can be used as an ingredient!To add your own meal items that affect nutrition, use the ‘forge’ tags ‘meat_meal,’ ‘fruit_meal,’ ‘veggie_meal,’ ‘sweet_meal,’ and ‘fish_meal.HIGHLIGHTSThe hardest part by far was making the Recipe GUI functional- and coming up with a new concept for the system when it quickly became clear it would take well over a week to make anything vaguely resembling Minecraft’s usual recipe books, at the least. The idea for recipes was suggested by my playtester, bless his heart. …I’ll grudgingly admit it is less than intuitive to randomly plug ingredients in and hope for the best…The most time consuming part was getting rice to work, especially given that I went into it with no idea how to make a plant that grows, animated textures, or structures that naturally generate in the world. It wasn’t too difficult- however, making several half-decent animated textures for different growth stages took far longer than I expected…My favorite part is (and continues) to be the cheeses, which were the first thing I created, and indeed, the very first modded thing of my making. (The Dragon Achievement is, unfortunately, a close second.) I love the idea of food that by its very nature requires some amount of dedication and interaction, for a reward I hope is actually worthwhile. Getting custom models to work was tricky, but ultimately because I was an idiot who didn’t understand the difference between file types…", "Published time": "6/1/22 2:53 pm", "Views": 2246, "Downloads": 308, "Credit": "Big thanks to Mcreator for making it possible for a dummy such as myself to do code!", "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.19.2", "Tags": "Food, Plants, Vanilla, Foods, Cooking, Sandwiches, Foodstuff, Vanillaplus, Soups, Other"},

At the moment there are three stages:Normal Mode, which starts at the beginning of the game.Expert Mode, which starts when the first player enters the Nether.(or enters any dimension from other mods)Master Mode, which starts when you defeat the Ender Dragon.Groups of enemiesEnemies appear in groups with one leader andfollowers who attack the same target as the leader.Followers are more likely to have weapons and leaders to have armors.Undead Army (new Raid)The new raid starts after killing a certain amount ofundead enemies. It has up to 5 waves, rewards the player with a treasurebag after finishing it, scales difficulty over time and scales difficulty with each player participating in!Treasure BagsNew Terraria-inspired bags that contain some extra loot and have a chance for one unique item. Each player receivestheir own Treasure Bag when they help to defeat a raid/boss. Currently, you can acquire them from:Fishing, Undead Army, Raid, Elder Guardian, Warden, Wither and Ender Dragon.BleedingEach animal and human being can now bleed. This is an effect that deals damage similar to poison and can beremoved using only a new item: Bandage. The chance of bleeding is lower the more pieces of armor youhave and it is caused by many different sources such as receiving sword damage, being bittenby a spider, or by touching a cactus... It is important to keep bandages with you at all timesbecause bleeding becomes more deadly as the game progresses!Enderium IngotsNew late-game ore: Enderium.

Crouch toggleable function pack that causes the entire tree to get cut after breaking the support. Upside-down pyramid shape chopping effect!How to use the add-on?First of all, EXPERIMENTAL MODE is not required! No need to enable game-test or holiday features. No scripts are required. Once activated in-game, it is toggleable based on whether or not you are crouching. Once crouched, any blocks you mine that are wood blocks will break any wood blocks above them, allowing you to install mine a tree. Once you un-crouch, this ability will de-activate and you can resume as normal. Chopping a tree without crouching means the tree chops normally. This is player-dependant, meaning if someone on the other side of the world is crouching but you are not, any trees that you chop will not decapitate unless you are crouched.InstallationWhen installing this addon, first locate the Addon download, which takes you to the full download site, with all the features listed above, as well as a quick download.Assuming you pressed the Download link, wait 6 seconds for the top right corner to say \"skip\".

{"Title": "STAR WARS ARC–170 ADD-ON [Bedrock edition]", "Description": "The ARC-170 fighter-bomber was the result of the joint development of Incom and Subpro corporations. It was developed at the beginning of the Clone Wars and began entering the Republican Navy in the first year of the war, becoming the first multifunctional fighter in the Grand Army of the RepublicThe fighter is controlled by three people – the pilot, the weapons operator and the gunner. Due to the extensive range of weapons, an armament operator was included in the crew of the ARC-170, the presence of which made it possible to aim missiles more efficiently and not distract the pilot from the direct control of the fighter. Due to the relatively low maneuverability, which was much inferior to most of the KNS fighter droids, it required the presence of a side-gunner covering the rear hemisphere. Due to the presence of a hyperdrive, an astrodroid was also included in the crew, whose tasks included navigation and calculating coordinates for hyperjumping.One of the technological innovations used (see note) was the sliding S-wings. They are aerodynamic planes that improve the stabilization of the vehicle in the atmosphere, which allows the ARC-170 to conduct an effective air battle in planetary space and carry out equally effective strikes on ground targets. In addition, the S-wings remove excess heat generated by the engines and are projectors of the protective field. By the way, in terms of security, the ARC-170 could only be compared with the no less perfect, heavy fighter-bomber BTL-B Y-Wing.The presence of powerful sensors, a hyperdrive and a long flight range (by the way, five times more than the legendary X-wing) made it possible to use the ARC-170 as a long-range scout.During the Clone Wars, ARC-170 squadrons inflicted great damage to the separatist fleet, taking part in both small long-range raids and major battles. During the Battle of Coruscant – one of the final battles of the Clone Wars – the ARC-170 squadron, under the command of a clone named Davijaan (call sign \"Odd Ball\"), covered Obi-Wan and Anakin who were breaking through to the separatist flagship. Later, the same squadron dealt a significant blow to some ships of the KNS fleet. It was with ARC-170 cannons, the clone pilot Jai'galaar (Jai'galaar) over Kato Neimoidia that the Delta-7 Plo Kuna was shot down, during the execution of \"Order 66\".The resulting Galactic Empire made full use of the technology inherited from it. The only external difference between the Imperial ARC-170 was the color. Now the sides of the ARC-170 have lost the variegated colors and individual emblems that they could boast of during the Clone Wars; all fighters have been repainted in light gray with imperial markings. It is not known exactly how long the ARC-170 was in service with the Imperial Navy.Subsequently, the experience gained during the creation and use of the ARC-170 was used in the development of the legendary X-Wing fighterAvailable on Minecraft version 1.17 and higherИстребитель-бомбардировщик ARC-170 был результатом совместной разработки корпораций Инком и Субпро. Он был разработан в начале Войны Клонов и начал поступать в республиканский флот в первый год войны, став первым многофункциональным истребителем в ВАР.Истребителем управляют три человека – пилот, оператор вооружения и бортстрелок. Из-за обширной номенклатуры оружия, в состав экипажа ARC-170 был включен оператор вооружения, наличие которого позволяло эффективнее наводить и ракеты и не отвлекать, тем самым, пилота от непосредственного управления истребителем. Из-за относительно невысокой маневренности, сильно уступавшей большинству дроидов-истребителей КНС, потребовалось наличие бортстрелка, прикрывавшего заднюю полусферу. Из-за наличия гипердвигателя, в экипаж был включен и астродроид, в задачи которого входила навигация и счисление координат для осуществления гиперпрыжка.Одной из примененных технологических новинок (см. примечание) стали раздвижные S-крылья. Они являются аэродинамическими плоскостями, улучшающими стабилизацию машины в атмосфере, что позволяет ARC-170 вести эффективный воздушный бой в планетарном пространстве и осуществлять не менее эффективные удары по наземным целям. Кроме этого S-крылья отводят излишнее тепло вырабатываемое двигателями и являются проекторами защитного поля. Кстати, по уровню защищенности, ARC-170 мог сравниться только, с не менее совершенным, тяжелым истребителем-бомбардировщиком BTL-В Y-Wing.Наличие мощных сенсоров, гипердвигателя и большой дальности полета (к слову, в пять раз больше чем у легендарного «крестокрыла») позволило использовать ARC-170 в качестве дальнего разведчика.Во время Войны Клонов эскадрильи ARC-170 наносили большой урон сепаратистскому флоту, принимая участие, как в небольших дальних рейдах, так и в крупных баталиях. Во время битвы за Корускант – одного из финальных сражений Войны Клонов – эскадрилья ARC-170, под командованием клона по имени Давиджаан (Davijaan) (позывной «Чудила» (Odd Ball)) прикрывала Оби-Вана и Энакина прорывавшихся к флагману сепаратистов. Позже, эта же эскадрилья, нанесла ощутимый удар по некоторым кораблям флота КНС. Именно пушками ARC-170, клон-пилотом Джай’галааром (Jai’galaar) над Като Неймодией был сбит Дельта-7 Пло Куна, в ходе выполнения «Приказа 66».Образовавшаяся Галактическая Империя в полной мере использовала технику, доставшуюся ей в наследство. Единственным внешним отличием имперских ARC-170 стала окраска. Теперь борта ARC-170 лишились пестрых цветов и индивидуальных эмблем, которыми могли похвастаться во время Войны Клонов; все истребители были перекрашены в светло-серый цвет с нанесением имперских опознавательных знаков. Точно неизвестно, насколько долго ARC-170 состояли на вооружении имперского флота.Впоследствии, опыт, полученный при создании и использовании ARC-170, был использован при разработке легендарного истребителя X-WingАддон работает и актуален на версии 1.17.0 и выше вплоть до 1.19.20", "Published time": "10/18/22 6:05 am", "Views": 901, "Downloads": 250, "Credit": null, "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.17", "Tags": "New Content, Addon, Clone, Starwars, Air, Bedrock, Ship, Republic, Transport, Bedrockedition, Clonewars, Star Wars, Bedrockaddon"},

The two most important aspects of normals hammers is their durability, which is 10% better than pickaxes', regardless of each ore, and their efficiency, which is a bit worse (slower), compared to pickaxes.Whereas Enhanced Hammers' durability is 30% better than pickaxes' and also the efficiency is a bit higher (faster)! What's the catch with them? They are harder to craft, naturally, for example, you're gonna need an Enhanced Stick instead of a regular one.

{"Title": "Fire & Growth (Mindthemood's Ashen Remains)", "Description": "This (was) the second mod I ever made. At the time, I figured it couldn't possibly be that difficult to make fire a bit more interesting. Oh how wrong I was.To make a long story short, the latest version of this mod took several days longer then I expected to get working, but the main point is that it, (unlike the previous version), actually works! The list of bugfixes wound up being more than two pages, which, at the very least, implies I learned a thing or two about modding since I last worked on this. THIS MOD DOES THE FOLLOWING:Makes fire based on random ticks. This means fire will spread much slower, but will be much less performance heavy. If you turn particles down, it can spread more or less indefinitely without any real performance hit.Changes how fire spreads; some blocks can be transformed into different variants by fire, and some blocks, (such as grass), can now spread fire, allowing for much larger blazes.Adds ash and charred wood materials, which are created when flammable blocks are burnt. This unique wood set breaks easily when exposed to water, and adds more atmosphere to burnt out places.Adds griefers, a crispy version of a creeper, which runs around making a mess and lighting things on fire in self-defense.Improves upon the Wither fight with cool effects and an overabundance of soul sand.Adds flowering grass, which spreads new plants in barren areas based on the biome and surroundings; this allows burnt out areas to gradually grow back without player intervention.Makes a bunch of other miscellaneous tweaks to fire, and everything related to fire.DISCLAIMERSYes, I am aware the fire spreads slower than Vanilla fire. This is an intentional gameplay mechanic. Or rather, it's a necessary consequence of making stuff random tick based, so I'm going to call it intentional. If you really want faster fire, I took all of the images sped up to randomtickspeed 30, and didn't have any frame issues.This mod makes creepers explode when lit on fire. If you have a mob farm involving campfires or the like, make sure to disable or modify the farm before downloading this mod!If you are having performance issues, it's most likely particles overloading the game. This usually won't be an issue unless you start a really big fire though.If you're looking for more, (better quality) images, or want the 1.18.2 version, ﻿feel free to check out the curseforge page.CHANGELOGFlowering Grass now generates naturally in all biomes- it looks identical to normal grass. However, over time, it replenishes foliage if space is available.When ticked, Flowering grass produces a randomly selected plant above it based on the biome and surrounding foliage.Plants only grow if space and sunlight is available- areas shouldn't get too overgrown.Some plants, (namely, grass), are more likely to generate than others.After growing a plant, flowering grass reverts to normal grass, and spreads to a nearby grass block a ways away.Crying Obsidian prevents flowering grass from growing things within three blocks of it.Flowering grass can be obtained renewably from ash, or by simply bonemealing it. You'll need Silk Touch to pick it up though.~~~In place of Saplings, (Which can now only be obtained by mining young trees), Each type of leaf block has a chance of dropping its corresponding Seeds. (Oak trees drop Oak Acorns, Birch trees drop Birch Fronds, Dark Oak trees drop Dark Acorns, Acacia trees drop Acacia Fronds, Spruce trees drop Pinecones, and Jungle Trees drop Seedpods, which are edible.)Leaves only drop things if mined directly by a player. (This is primarily to prevent lag from seed drops in large fires.)Seeds can be used to plant Sprouts, small plants that eventually grow into their corresponding saplings. (Essentially, you’ll get more seeds per tree, but they’ll take longer to grow unless you’ve got a healthy supply of bonemeal.)If you’ve also got ‘Cooking with Mindthemoods’ installed, you can use acorns, dark acorns, and seed pods to make a pair of new snacks!~~~A couple other mobs and things have seen some minor tweaks to make them just a bit more interesting…Creepers now generate moss when they explode, if there are mossable blocks nearby. They can also mossify stone bricks and other blocks with moss variants in the explosion radius.On average, (due to moss’s low blast resistance), this slightly increases the size of creeper craters. Usually, moss and lush-cave type foliage accumulates around the edge of the explosion crater.Regular Creepers have a chance of exploding whenever they take fire damage.Trees grown from saplings can generate rooted dirt beneath them, and occasional wood-blocks as roots directly to their sides. (This is mostly to make them fit better with the trees in Mindthemood's Pile of Rocks, but is also just kind of a nice feature. In my opinion.)Ghast Explosions can now convert netherack and grass-type blocks to soul sand or soul soil.Blazes ignite nearby blocks when injured.The Nether Fortress and Nether Portal Loot Tables have been modified to include Flint and Tinder instead of Flint and Steel. (Along with increased chances of fire charges, and other minor adjustments.)~~~Fire has been completely overhauled. (As such it may be best to simply start from scratch, and go over each mechanic in turn.) While many aspects are similar, there’s also been some major modifications to how it works.Fire can be started using Flint and Tinder, a relatively breakable item made using an iron nugget, flint, and wheat. Flint and Tinder can be used on the top or side of flammable or semi-flammable blocks to light a fire. (Though they only work about 70% of the time- which, admittedly, is much better than the real life equivalent.)Fire generally spreads more slowly, and usually won’t spread too far unless you’re either really trying, or really inattentive.Alternatively, you can use Fire Charges- they can start fires much more consistently, and fires started by charges do not spread. However, doing so consumes the item. Crucially, only a Fire Charge can ignite a Nether Portal. As such, you’ll have to first obtain one from a ruined portal (or a griefer) in order to enter the Nether.Some blocks, (Wooden materials, wool, leaves, moss, etc.), are Flammable, and allow fire to spread to and destroy them. Other blocks, (Such as mossy stone materials, grass, rooted dirt, coal ores, etc.), are Semi-Flammable- fire can spread to them, but will only alter rather than destroy. (Grass becomes dirt, mossy bricks become plain, regular bricks become cracked, etc.) Finally, some blocks are Ignored by fire, and are immedieately destroyed when it spreads. (Carpets, candles, torches, and other partial blocks.)Water, Water Bottles, Rain, Nearby Spore Blossoms, and Biomes with high humidity all slow or stop fire. (The particles are pretty, but now you can also use them as reasonably proficient fire extinguishers.)Lava no longer lights things on fire- however, if flammable blocks are placed nearby, they will immediately ignite.Items made from obsidian, netherrak, etc, (including Nether Stars), are immune to burning up from regular fire.Punching anything that’s on fire without a tool or water item in your hand deals damage to players without fire resistance. (And damages the tool otherwise.)Mobs that are on fire can start additional fires below them. (This behavior is less likely to occur for players, but is still something to watch out for.)Flaming arrows start fires. (You have no idea how much work went into this particular bullet point…)~~~Fire can generate Ash when it burns things- ash is similar to powdered snow, and just about as unpleasant.Blocks of Ash can be picked up with a bucket and placed elsewhere, or mined with a shovel to drop Ashballs, which are heavier than snowballs, and have a chance of inflicting blindness on their target. Ashballs can be crafted back into an Ash Bucket, which can be shot from a dispenser to drop ash layers.Ash slows movement and jump height based on how much of it has accumulated- if it’s higher than one block, it also inflicts blindness on anything in it.Entities without fire protection, immunity, or resistance randomly take small amounts of damage while walking through ash- if you’re wearing armor without fire resistance, your armor will take damage instead.Mobs can spawn in ash that is more than a block deep; as it blocks light but is still considered a spawnable surface.If fire is nearby, ash can become Flaming Ash, which is more or less the same thing- save in that it deals more damage to anything inside it, as well as their armor. Fire Resistance negates this property. (And, to a lesser degree, Fire Protection.) Flaming Ash can start additional fires on nearby blocks.Ash gradually dissipates in rain, and, when dissipated this way, has a chance of generating grass or flowering grass beneath it.~~~The Wither has seen some thematic (and gameplay oriented) tweaks, including the following:Activated Soul Sand/Soil is produced when the Wither Altar is created, more for dramatic effect than anything else. It makes strange noises, and pulses with an unholy light… the stuff can also be generated by Wither explosions, and occasionally spawns wither skeletons when the Wither or the player is nearby.Wither explosions now generate soul soil, soul sand, and soul flames. (So now you’ll also need to down some Fire Resistance and/or get yourself soul speed. It does occur to me a guy who’s only fought the thing once, yesterday in fact, may not be the most qualified to modify this abomination... but it's pretty cool, right?)Upon death, the Wither extinguishes nearby soul fires to try to avoid lighting the Star on fire.~~~Griefers are a new, less threatening, but arguably more annoying version of the creeper. They avoid players, randomly accumulate ash, can set things on fire when injured, and are generally a nuisance.Griefers only spawn when a creeper gets stuck in ash.Griefers inflict blindness if attacked at close proximity, and panic when attacked. Upon death, they generate a pile of ash and flames.Griefers take continuous damage in rain, and can be killed especially quickly using water.Griefers drop Fire Charges, Gunpowder, and Ashballs when killed- as well as slightly more experience then regular creepers. (It might just be worth it to convert them for a farm... if you're willing to deal with the fires.)~~~Finally, You can also obtain Charred Wood, (A new wood set), exclusively from lighting things on fire. (Not that I, of course, would dream of incentivizing arson.)Charred Wood is fireproof, and more durable than regular wood- so long as it doesn’t get wet. It produces ash and charcoal if mined without Silk Touch.All wooden materials have a small chance of becoming charred instead of turning to ash when burnt.Charred Wood has a variety of variants, all of which can only be obtained by lighting normal wooden materials on fire. Charred doors, fences, planks, slabs, etc; cannot be crafted through regular means, and are only obtainable through fires. (They’re a hot commodity, in a sense.)STRATEGYFire prioritizes spreading upwards, (like before), but can also easily spread downwards through flaming ash- which can ignite adjacent sides. However, ash only remains flaming if there is fire nearby. If there isn’t much fire, focus on extinguishing the flames, and the ash will stop igniting more fires. Otherwise, in a larger fire, prioritize getting the ash first. (If you’re trying to start a fire, start from the bottom and work your way up.)Both Fire Protection Armor and Fire Resistance Potions can mitigate the damaging, (but not the blinding) effects of ash. Keep in mind that if you’re using Potions, any non-netherite armor without fire protection will still be damaged by ash, even if you won’t be. Fire Resistance is a better option if you can get it.Generally speaking, the modified fire spreads slower than Vanilla fire- however, it’s also substantially more annoying to extinguish once it gets going. If you catch a fire early, you’ll probably be able to get rid of it with relative ease- water buckets are the quickest method of extinguishing things, with a good shovel being a close second, and a spore blossom being the best if you've got one handy.If you’re really concerned about something flammable, use spore blossoms to prevent fire spread in an area. Any fires within five blocks in any direction of a spore blossom are immediately put out instead of spreading when ticked.Trenches and walls can also be fairly effective, as fire requires adjacent flammable blocks to spread. Again, just watch out for flaming ash, which can spread downwards and slightly sideways in some cases.Be careful with Fire Aspect and Flame- both flaming arrows and flaming mobs can spread fire now- the odds of it happening are low, and you can usually extinguish it easily if you’re looking out for it, but make sure to stay on guard! (This behavior doesn’t effect the undead, so you should be fine with skeletons, zombies, and the like.)In the event that a forest burns down, (possibly at your hands), you might be better off just leaving it be. Both ash and charred blocks degrade when exposed to rain, and can generate flowering grass- which can slowly reforest an area. (If you’re patient.) Traces of charred stuff might remain, but in my humble opinion, they merely add character. It's certainly going to be less work than cleaning it up yourself.When dealing with Griefers, water is the best option. They won’t actually fight back, but will try to both ignite things on fire, and avoid your attacks. Try to stay out of range of their blindness effect, and ideally dispatch them in a single shot, before they can panic and light stuff on fire.ACHIVEMENTSAbandon All Hope ~ Obtain a Fire Charge from a Griefer or a Ruined PortalAsking for Trouble ~ Bring a Blaze into any especially flammable biome.TECHNICALIMPORTANTLY, this mod replaces existing fire with its own custom blocks- and disables regular fire tick when loaded. Normal fire still exists in the game, on blocks that burn indefinitely, and from non-spreading fire summoned by bed explosions and fire charges. If you don’t want modded fire to spread, use the ‘doFireSpread’ gamerule.If you don’t want flowering grass to grow and spread, use the ‘doPlantGrowth’ gamerule.Flowering Grass does the following with a 0.2 chance when it receives a random tick:Attempts to grow something on top of it as long as there is not crying obsidian nearby.If successful, spreads an additional flowering grass block to a random grass block 2-6 blocks away on the X and Z axis, and anywhere on the Y axis at world surface height. The target location cannot have any plants or flowering grass blocks directly adjacent to it, and must have air above it.Becomes normal grass if there is something on top of it.Flaming Ash does the following when it receives a random tick, in the following order:Converts to regular ash if it cannot detect a fire block within three blocks in any direction.If it is not raining, attempts to light an adjacent block on fire- either on a block directly adjacent, below, or two below.Sets Bottom Fire on the block directly above or two above if it is flammable.Converts the block below it with a 25% chance; otherwise:Removes the block below it if the block below it is flammable, with a 75% chance.Regular Fire does the following when it receives a random tick, in the following order:Extinguishes if it's in rain and has clear access to the sky/is only covered with non-solid blocks; or if there is a spore blossom within five blocks.Causes a transformation on its current block, either converting it to a charred variant or ash for wooden materials; or causing a different transformation for semi_flammable blocks. (Such as converting bricks to cracked bricks, mossy bricks to bricks, rooted dirt to dirt, etc.)Attempts to spread upwards, up to four blocks.Selects adjacent blocks to spread to. Blocks are determined from the connected block, and are considered a success if they are flammable. The number of rolls for adjacent blocks is 4 by default; and becomes less in rainy conditions/wet biomes, and more in dry biomes and in Hard difficulty.Vanishes if it spread successfully, or has no adjacent flammable blocks.Places fire on the adjacent blocks it spread to. The sides that fire are placed on are determined randomly, prioritizing the top. Fire only ignites on the bottom if no other surface is available.The Mod uses the following tags to make things work:The Minecraft ‘Fire’ Tag is used to make mobs treat modded fire as a danger source, and to extinguish fires using splash bottles. (As well as for compatibility with future mods.)The Forge ‘Flammable’ Tag determines which materials can both spread and be burnt up by fire. It includes wool, wooden materials, and leaves.The Forge ‘Semi_Flammable’ Tag determines which materials can spread fire, but undergo unique transformation processes. (Used to convert mossy materials, coal, and grass type blocks.)Blocks tagged with Forge ‘Fire_Ignore’ are destroyed by falling ash, and by adjacent fires- they can be converted to ash in the process. This includes candles, crops, and most plants.Blocks tagged with Forge ‘Semi_Fire_Ignore’ are not directly flammable, and are converted instead of destroyed by nearby fire. (Exclusively includes wooden doors, fences, trapdoors, and fence gates; as well as mossy walls and slabs.)The ‘Ashblocks’ tag is exclusively used for the ash accumulation process, and does not include the full block variants of ash and flaming ash.Entities tagged as ‘Ash_Immune’ are immune to damaging effects from ash and flaming ash. (Includes Blazes, Wither Skeletons, and Griefers.)Items tagged as ‘Ash_Destroyable’ are destroyed shortly after colliding with blocks tagged with Ashblocks. (Includes seeds and sticks- prevents burning forests from lagging due to item entities.)Blocks tagged as ‘Ghast_Destroyable’ can be converted to soul materials by ghasts and withers.Items tagged as ‘Fire_Resist’ are not ignited by modded fire.Blocks tagged as 'Saplings' prevent flowering grass from growing additional saplings nearby even if there is available space/sky access.HIGHLIGHTSThe most infuriating part of this particular mod was, appropriately enough, the Griefers. I decided early on that I wanted their texture to be animated, (like the Ash), but quickly discovered that animated textures in Mcreator only support square texture files at multiples of 8. And guess which texture file is one of the few in the game that isn’t a perfect square? Creepers! I spent a copious amount of time trying to find a workaround, and concluded that even in modding, the little bastards are a nuisance… I eventually settled for making the things glow, but now whenever I see the slightly crispy little monsters, I’ll be reminded of my failures. At which point they’ll start lighting things on fire, and I’ll start wondering what led me to create this abomination in the first place....The most infuriating part going back into the mod for a second time was finally getting everything working, then deciding to simplify and rewrite the growth procedures for Flowering Grass... and realizing they were super complicated for a reason. Turns out the ratios of plants need to be really just so for it to look more or less natural.The Most time consuming part of this mod was repeatedly lighting large forests and mansions on fire to see if the spreading was working properly. (Or at the very least, resembled something functional.) At some point I had to test it at the regular tickspeed, (for science.) I can say with certainty that the novelty of repeatedly striking large mansions with lighting wore off quickly. (And also, should I ever renovate the mansions, the first thing I intend to add are lighting rods.)The Best part of designing this mod was the first time I burnt a forest down, and was able to watch it grow back- after rewriting the firespread procedure for the umpteenth time, it was amazing to have it finally work.", "Published time": "6/12/22 6:57 pm", "Views": 1323, "Downloads": 46, "Credit": "Thanks again to the folks at MCreator; keep up the good work!", "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.19.2", "Tags": "Tweaks, Plants, Fire, Ash, Growth, Destruction, Burning, Other, Charred, Regrowth"},

It is also the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a circle-shaped minimap and a separate setting for locking the minimap's rotation (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including players, mobs and items, as dots with a custom color or as icons (usually heads). In addition to the default compass directions, you can place your own waypoints that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world. Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with optional teleportation. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (cave mode). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP. This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.Follow me on Twitter? twitter.com/xaero96Support me on Patreon? patreon.com/xaero96 (in-game rewards, goals for removing ads and more)Look of vanilla Minecraft.Multiple minimap size options including automatic.Multiple zoom options.Two minimap shape options: square or circle.Runs smoother than a lot of minimap mods.Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen. You can even shift it by 1 pixel if you so wish. Can be useful when playing with other UI mods.2 block color modes: Vanilla, which uses the colors of vanilla Minecraft maps and Accurate, which uses the colors of block textures and biomes. You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around. All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu. There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.Compatible with Xaero's World Map. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add minimapItemId:minecraft:compass anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending _harmful to the end of the effect ID, for example xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful.Translated to a lot of languages.Option to lock north to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.Works both above and under ground thanks to the automatic cave mode. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.Waypoints. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press B to create a new waypoint. Press U to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.Local and global waypoints. To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.Waypoint sets. You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.Waypoint sharing. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).Deathpoints. An automatic skull-shaped waypoint is created on each death. Old deathpoints are converted to regular waypoints, which you can disable using the \"Keep Old Deathpoints\" setting.Displays chunk claims and ally players from the Open Parties and Claims mod.Togglable chunk grid. The chunk grid shows you where block chunks begin and end.Togglable slime chunks mode. The chunks where slimes can spawn are marked with a green overlay.Custom light overlay. You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\". You can do it through the Waypoints Menu (press U) -> Options screen.Displays mobs on the map as yellow dots. Hostile and friendly mobs can be colored differently. Can also be displayed as icons/heads. Check the \"Entity Radar\" settings.Displays players on the map as white dots or player heads. Can also be displayed as icons/heads. Check the \"Entity Radar\" settings.Displays items on the map as red dots. Check the \"Entity Radar\" settings.Displays all the other entities such as arrows and item frames as purple dots. Different types of entities can be disabled in the settings. Check the \"Entity Radar\" settings.Options for displaying entity names on the minimap in the \"Entity Radar\" settings.Zoom in and out key bindings (I and O by default) to efficiently change the zoom level to fit your preference or use case.Coordinates under the minimap.Current biome name under the minimap. Disabled by default and needs to be enabled in the mod settings (press Y).Light level under the minimap. Also disabled by default and needs to be enabled in the mod settings (press Y).Current game time under the minimap. Disabled by default. You can choose between the 12 hour and the 24 hour formats.Current camera angles under the minimap. Disabled by default.Setting to hide/unhide all waypoint coordinates from all UI screens. Can be useful for streams/videos.Setting to fully hide/unhide all mentions of server addresses in dropdown menus. The setting is set to \"Partial\" by default, which is probably good enough in most cases.A LOT MORE SETTINGS. Too many to list them all here. Press Y in game to open the settings and take a look.2 mod editions: full and fair-play. Full version does not have any limits. Fair-play version does not display any entities or cave maps which is more suitable for PVP against people who don't use a minimap.How to install the Fabric version:Download and install the Fabric Loader.Download Fabric API and put it in the \"mods\" folder in the Minecraft game directory. Download the Fabric version of the minimap mod for your Minecraft version and put it in the mods folder.Start the Fabric game \"installation\" using the Minecraft launcher.

The mod sends a chat command to teleport you to the waypoints, which is /tp @s x y z by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option.If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -> XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.Your waypoints are no longer shown for a specific server?Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the \"Your world map has \"reset\" for a specific server?\" section on the world map description page. Done with that? Please continue reading.Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in, then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-LEFT dropdown menu, select it and do Options -> Make World/Server Auto. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.Using the world map mod?One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6). Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on. Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting Options -> Make Sub-World Auto.Not using the world map mod? The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:Spoiler - Click To Expand1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?2. Use Options -> Make sub-world auto. 3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same Options menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.Contact me if you have questions!Want to add your own entity icons or override the default ones?First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -> Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is /assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type /assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json. The example file would corresponds to the entity type example_mod:example_entity, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file example_entity.json to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.In addition to that, /assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/ contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.If you set the \"debugEntityVariantIds\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file /assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json for all the information you need to know.

{"Title": "Superior Smithing (Mindthemood's Marvelous Modifications)", "Description": "As things are, the smithing table has, (count ‘em), nine measly recipes, leading one to wonder why, exactly, it even ought to be its own crafting station. To better recognize this beautiful little block’s full potential, I’ve taken it upon myself to let you use (almost) any vanilla material to modify (nearly) every piece of equipment in the game.  Now, using the Smithing Table, you can combine the likes of Leather, Copper, Iron, Gold, Diamonds, and Netherite Scrap with any tool, weapon, or piece of armor. (With the notable exception of ranged weapons, which I may or may not get to later.) Different modifications have different ambient benefits, and all can be removed using a grindstone.  Modifications for your tools are compatible with enchantments- and on the subject of enchantments, you can now make use of four new enchantments I also took it upon myself to add. (Curse of Severing, Lunar Effigy, Curse of Memory, and Life Sink)  …Also, as I was designing and testing the over 900 unique items you can make with this, (most of them dyed variants of leather-bound items), I happened to notice that the crafting table, (Unlike, say, every other crafting station in the game), has no sound effects. So I added those too.CHANGELOGThe Smithing Table can now be used to ‘modify’ armor, weapons, and tools, to give ambient benefits and visual tweaks based on the material used. All modified equipment can be enchanted; and conversely, you can modify equipment that has already been enchanted. (Keep in mind though that the Grindstone removes both.)All Modifications can be removed using a grindstone. This leaves the base equipment, but not the actual item used to modify it. (Also, the Grindstone GUI has been overhauled to accommodate this. Which is to say I’ve added a button.)Specifically, Swords, Axes, Pickaxes, Shovels, Hoes, Helmets, Turtle Shells, Boots, Chestplates, and Leggings can currently be modified using a Smithing Table. (Possibly with more in the future if I can figure out how to do bows and tridents)Modified items can be repaired on an anvil using either of their component ingredients. (If you modify a Diamond item with copper, you can repair it with Copper in addition to Diamonds.)You can only have one modification per item, so choose wisely!Different Materials have different ambient benefits- there isn’t one in particular that’s better than the rest. Use Leather to create Bound equipment. This has some small improvements towards speed and toughness- but more importantly, allows you to dye normally non-dyeable equipment any of the game’s 16 colors. (At least partly.) In addition, Leather armor is by far the easiest to repair, and offers protection from freezing.Use Copper to create Reinforced equipment. This solely improves durability.Use Iron to create Riveted equipment. This improves efficiency, damage, and durability; at the expense of speed and enchantability. Better for armor than for tools.Use Gold to create Gilded equipment. Gilded armor doesn’t aggravate piglins, and gilding dramatically increases the enchantability and efficiency of the item, at the expense of durability.Use Diamonds to create Jeweled equipment. This enhances damage, protection, toughness, and speed, and essentially improves everything but durability.Finally, use Netherite Scrap to create Forged equipment. This grants fire immunity to the item, and dramatically increases durability and toughness, as well as damage....And, with the addition of version 1.19, use Echo Shards to create Echoing equipment, which can be retained upon death! (Alongside some other noteworthy properties...)The Grindstone has been tweaked to be a bit more useful, and handy for modification.The Grindstone can repair any two items of the same type- however, it does so far more efficiently than other crafting stations; regardless of the damage of input items, the resulting item is randomly assigned about 80 to 90% durability, (consuming both of the input items.)If one of the items is enchanted, the enchantments have a 50% chance of carrying over. If both are enchanted, one of the item’s enchantments are chosen at random. (This is currently the only way to remove curses.)The Grindstone removes any non-curse enchantments. When an enchantment or modification is removed from an item, it usually regains a fair amount of durability.If an item is unenchanted, the Grindstone removes any modifications instead, returning the base item- which retains its current level of damage. This damages the item with however much damage it has currently sustained, plus an additional 5-20% of the item’s max durability.Four new Enchantments have been added.Curse of Severing simply increases the item’s chances of breaking when held. It can exclusively be found on loot.Lunar Effigy Is a unique treasure enchantment; it comes in 3 levels, and can be applied to any weapons. Weapons enchanted with Lunar Effigy do additional magical damage when the moon is full or waxing; and deal magic damage to the wielder when the moon is waning or new. In both instances, they do more damage at night than during the day.Life Sink can be applied to any piece of armor. It consumes EXP in order to quickly heal the wielder- healing up to one heart per orb of EXP. Incompatible with Mending.Curse of Memory is my personal take on the ever popular ‘Soul Binding’ enchantment idea. Essentially, this is the opposite of Curse of Vanishing- it prevents you from getting rid of the item. The item cannot be thrown away, cannot be stored, and is stuck in your inventory even through death. The only way to permanently get rid of it is to break it, melt it, or, (for some reason), throw it at a cactus.Bane of Arthropods has been tweaked slightly, not to make it any more useful, but to make it act like a curse in that you can no longer remove it using a grindstone. (You’re welcome.)A couple Loot Tables have been modified to include modded armor and enchantments. Specifically, Desert Pyramids, Stronghold Libraries, End Cities, certain Villager Trades, and Blacksmith/Toolsmith loot.And lastly, Sound Effects have been added to the crafting table, which play when items are crafted.The material of the item determines which sound effect plays, with distinct sounds for wooden, stone, metallic, glass, and magical items.Any items with a non-specified sound play the default item-pickup sound when crafted.ACHIEVEMENTSModify & Sever ~ Use a Smithing Table to modify something.Questionable Fashion Choices ~ Create and equip a full set of Forged Leather Armor.TECHNICALLeather Binding ~ Effects are almost purely visual; items retain their basic properties.Weapons/Tools gain +30% Attack Speed.Armor gains +0.5 ToughnessBound armor provides protection from freezing.Bound items can be dyed any color.

Works as a separate mod but is a lot better with Xaero's Minimap. The reason why it's available separately is to keep Xaero's Minimap as light-weight as possible. This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.The mod is still in development! Please report any bugs that you encounter or otherwise they won't get fixed. You can private message me to report bugs. Make sure your world is optimized (Singleplayer - Edit - Optimize World) for the Minecraft version you're playing (repeat after every Minecraft update). It takes A LOT longer to generate singleplayer maps from unoptimized world saves.Install by dropping the jar into the Minecraft Forge's mods folder, as usual. A step-by-step guide is available on the download page.Follow me on Twitter? twitter.com/xaero96Support me on Patreon? patreon.com/xaero96 (in-game rewards, goals for removing ads and more)Current Mod Features:A self-writing world map (as opposed to manual paper maps). You can create multiple maps on the same server address and switch between them either manually or automatically.Works in Singleplayer, Multiplayer and on Realms.Intuitive interface. Open the map screen by pressing M. Move the map around with your mouse and zoom in/out using the mouse wheel, similar to Google Maps. All relevant controls are listed in a tooltip on the map screen and you can customize a lot of them.Optional automatic multiple world detection on servers.Displays chunk claims and ally players from the Open Parties and Claims mod. Lets you claim or forceload chunks directly from the map.Resource pack support. Changing the resource packs causes the whole world map to regenerate.Cave dimensions support (for example the Nether).Optional vanilla maps mode, which makes the world map look like the vanilla paper maps.Terrain shading customization.\"Footsteps\" that show you your most recent path taken.Settings that can help improve the performance of the mod when necessary. Although in most cases the mod should perform great by default.Xaero's Minimap integration. The minimap mod will display chunks provided by the world map. The world map mod will display waypoints from the Xaero's Minimap mod. Also works with the Better PVP mod. You can create, edit and teleport to the waypoints without leaving the map interface.Potion effects to control the usage of the world map for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: xaeroworldmap:no_world_map. The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending _harmful to the end of the effect ID, for example xaeroworldmap:no_world_map_harmful.Since version 1.14.0 of the mod, you can open an on-map waypoint menu by clicking the icon in the bottom right corner of the map screen. In the waypoint menu, you can see a list of all your map waypoints from the rendered sets, interact with them with the mouse cursor, filter them by name in a text field. The menu also lets you toggle the visibility of disabled waypoints, toggle rendering all sets and change the current waypoint set. Hovering over the waypoints in the menu also acts as hovering over them on the map: they are highlighted on the map and you can use the right-click or hover controls to interact with them.An option to export a map as a PNG image file. The mod tries to export the whole map, so it might not work, if the map is millions of blocks in length. I'm planning to give more options for exporting the map in the future!Option to limit your map access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add mapItemId:minecraft:compass anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the map will not work unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.How to install the Fabric version:Download and install the Fabric Loader.Download Fabric API and put it in the \"mods\" folder in the Minecraft game directory.Download the Fabric version of the map mod for your Minecraft version and put it in the mods folder.Start the Fabric game \"installation\" using the Minecraft launcher.Multiple worlds on the same server address/IP are using and writing to the same map?This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between Manual, World Spawn and Single modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the Map Selection option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including Server mode. World Spawn mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. Server mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming. Why does the world map ask for confirmation?A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is Manual, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between Manual, World Spawn and Single modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the Map Selection option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including Server mode. World Spawn mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. Server mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming. Can't see your waypoints on a server after installation?Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting Options -> Make Sub-World Auto.Your world map has \"reset\" for a specific server?Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client. Make sure you update the mod to the latest version. There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between, Manual being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps. You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. Server mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. Manual mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when Server mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.Old map is not in the map menu? This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.Let's start with the dimension ID change. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the game directory -> XaeroWorldMap directory. Please backup the XaeroWorldMap directory before you begin doing anything with it. In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1. For compatibility reasons, default overworld, nether and the end dimensions are named null, DIM-1 and DIM1. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the F3 screen ingame to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\"). Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example mw$default or mw-4,0,-4) as well as a file named dimension_config.txt that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame. The most common case would be something like moving a map from /null to /minecraft$overworld_survival. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.For server address changes, you would first have to remove all directories inside game directory -> XaeroWorldMap that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version. Please backup the whole XaeroWorldMap directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen. Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:Click to revealDo not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):Make sure Minecraft is NOT RUNNING.1. Go to the game directory2. Go to the XaeroWorldMap directory3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with _null is the overworld, _dim-1 is Nether etc.4. Open the overworld directory (_null).5. You should see multiple directories that start with mw.6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.7. Now find the newest mw directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else. Don't delete it just yet.8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.Contact me if you have questions!The world map is restored but the waypoints are still not?Please read the \"Your waypoints are no longer shown for a specific server?\" section on the minimap description page.

The Ghost Tech ability basically gives you tentacles, but you cannot lift yourself past half a block off the ground or else it was disable itself. You are also unable to jump with tentacles enabled so you don't immediately deactivate the tentacles when trying to toggle climb mode and jumping a block in the air. All the other abilities are self-explanatory. Fyi if you move around a lot while intangible, you will find some difficulties staying above ground, it's a problem with the tentacles and I'm not sure how to fix it, if anyone does, please tell me. I found that it's consistent if you don't travel through the ground often and toggling the intangibility on and off helps. Let me know if anything should be changed, any suggestions are welcomed.Feel free to add any textures you want to it if the lack of textures bothers you. Credits:RunnyHero-Code for disabling the tentacles when you go to high above the ground.Gillygogs-Code for not being able to jump when tentacles are enabled. Links to each of them in the credits file in the heropack. Permissions:Please ask RunnyHero or Gillygogs for permission for their code that I used, as those are really the only things worth stealing.

This addon is made for those who love symbiotes from different universes. Since the addon is brand new, there are only 4 characters. This will be fixed in the future. Symbiotes can shoot webs, climb ceilings, get symbiotic tentacles and open the mask. I will be very happy if other developers of fiskheroes addons (chiropacks) notice me, as I really want to learn how to make code better, add other heroes and new abilities.

{"Title": "\"Better than Adventure!\" for Beta 1.7.3 - Timely updates revolving around the theme of \"Minecraft without the adventure update\" [1.7.4_02]", "Description": "OverviewMinecraft has changed a lot since its initial beta period in 2011. The game has grown substantially, and new features, mechanics and systems continue to be added even to this day. While this is all well and good, there are still players out there who don't enjoy the direction the game took post-release, or simply have nostalgia for beta minecraft and wish to return to a time without hunger, experience or enchantments with a few bells and whistles on. Just pick up your pickaxe, mine some diamonds and build a castle!Better Than Adventure is designed to appeal to these players who enjoy the simpler gameplay of the old beta versions of Minecraft, yet also want to try something new and exciting. Think of it as an \"alternate universe\" version of minecraft that attempts to maintain the look-and-feel of beta 1.7.3, while also keeping things fresh with new features and additions such as new blocks, biomes and quality of life improvements. Despite what the name implies, this mod isn't necessarily trying to offer something inherently better than modern Minecraft, just something different. Think of it as a long-lost branch of Minecraft, what could have been if Notch and Jeb took the game in a slightly different direction all those years ago.While BTA is designed mostly to appeal to older players who grew up with beta, the aim of the mod in general is simply to offer an alterate take on the game. So if you're just looking for something new to enjoy, try this mod out too. You may like itFeaturesFeaturesUnder the hood, BTA is very different from vanilla beta 1.7.3. The majority of existing bugs have been ironed out and fixed, and almost the entire game has been rewritten and optimised to make the development of new additions much, much easier. For example, the game’s implementation of McRegion has been rewritten to allow for 256 block-high worlds, the game now has native support for HD texture packs, and the block ID system has been overhauled to allow for thousands of blocks, instead of beta 1.7.3’s hard-limit of 256.The fun doesn’t end there though, BTA also offers a plethora of new features and mechanics to play around with. The biggest of which is probably the new “seasonal cycle”.SeasonsMinecraft worlds now cycle through 4 seasons, over a span of 28 days (7 days per season). These seasons provide an interesting spin on survival gameplay; as the seasons change and winter begins to fall, the game will become progressively more challenging. Crops start to grow less often, mobs spawn more frequently, and the nights will become longer. It is important you plan around the changing seasons, stocking up on resources to survive the cold winter.Revamped Beta World GenerationThe iconic beta world generation has also been given a major touch-up in BTA. First and foremost, the sea-level has been risen to 128, which means 128 blocks of underground, and 128 blocks of overworld. This also means mountains can grow to twice the size they could than before, leading to even wackier terrain than normal.Biomes have been changed too, they now generate at around twice the size they used to, meaning no more ugly micro-deserts. Existing biomes have also been touched up to make them more unique, for example, swamplands now spawn with fields of algae and mossy trees, and seasonal forests spawn groves of cherry trees that shine a bright pink in the spring.Creative Mode One thing that beta 1.7.3 and below did lack was a functioning creative mode where you can test out contraptions and plan builds in a world with infinite blocks and health. This has been added to BTA, however its not just a simple port of beta 1.8’s creative mode. We thought we’d try and improve on it by adding better flying controls, a more readable creative inventory, and a list of single player commands.New Blocks3 new types of stone with brick and cobbled variants (Basalt, Granite and Limestone), painted wooden planks in 16 different dye colours, dirt paths, fence gates, new slab and stair variants for existing blocks, coloured Redstone lamps and many, many more blocks to expand your building capabilities with. As well as that, BTA also adds new blocks for Redstone contraptions, such as retractable ‘spike traps’ that damage mobs when stepped on, ‘motion sensors’ that activate when mobs move past them, and ‘mesh blocks’ that allow items to pass through them, yet block off mobs and players.SteelExploring the nether now has a purpose with the addition of steel, a refined form of iron, made from smelting iron bars in a blast furnace with a new nether-exclusive ore called “nether coal” that offers extremely high durability tools at the cost of being slightly slower at mining than diamond. It can also be used to make a rocket launcher. Quake style!The GuidebookBecause we understand that sometimes recipes can be difficult to discover, especially in modded games, we decided to add a “guidebook” accessed by pressing R in-game that tells you each of the recipes found in the game. However, this book works a little differently to how you’d expect…The book starts with all the items blacked out, filling out each item once obtained by the player to maintain the sense of discovery for those who enjoy finding things out for themselves. It also offers as a completion objective for players who wish to fill out the book completely and “craft ‘em all”. (But alternatively if you just want to see the new recipes for yourself, try opening the book in creative)ChangelogsAvailable on our Tumblr page.Or go to our Discord for more frequent updates, as well as access to pre-release snapshots.DownloadAuto Updating: MultiMC Update Utility (New)1.7.6.2_02 (Latest)Download: MultiMC InstanceDownload: Client JarDownload: Server JarPrevious Versions can be downloaded from our Minecraft Forum Page.InstallationRequires MultiMC or the Betacraft launcher!Installation: MultiMC Update UtilityThe MultiMC update utility will allow you to automatically update/load the latest release of BTA without having to install a brand new instance from the forum page!To install the utility, simply drag and drop that link onto your MultiMC instance list, then run it.

Warning, it will use the server.jar's host directory as a local directory meaning all the files it creates will be placed in whatever folder your jar is in! So try to put it in its own folder somewhere!QuestionsWhy is this mod made for such an old version? Will there be plans for a 1.17 release and above?The aim of this mod is to completely reconceptualize and refine minecraft's progression system and core gameplay loop - think of it more like a fork or \"alternate development branch\" than just a simple game mod. The reason I'm starting from beta 1.7.3 is because that was the last version to still contain that simple minecraft gameplay this mod is designed around expanding on, it makes a great springboard for new ideas since at that point in development, it felt like the game could go anywhere. Almost like starting from a blank slate again. Because of this, the mod will stay exclusive to b1.7.3, however I will be continually updating with new features and refinements as time goes on, so please check back for more!Is this mod compatible with other mods from around the same era?Currently this mod does not use an external API such as forge or modloader, meaning allthe changes to the codebase are base class edits. This might change but it has partially been done because an awful lot of refactoring has and will be done under the surface to make workflow easier, and maybe to improve optimisation and efficiency of the game also, however because of this, the unfortunate downside is a complete lack of compatibility withalmost any mod made for the game back then, which is regrettable, but due to the vast scope I have planned for this mod, compataibility issuesare going to be unavoidable anyway in the long run. People are still welcome to make mods for 1.7.4 and beyond, and will be encouraged! I plan to package modloader into later versions which will make developing mods specifically for BTA a lot easier!Why isn't this mod compatible with the default minecraft launcher?Currently there's an issue with the minecraft launcher not liking the mod, likely due to making changes to the Minecraft.class file. For now its recommended you use MultiMC or the Betacraft launcher for loading this mod.For any other assistance or suggestions/feedback feel free to leave a comment below.

{"Title": "Lost Chapters: Reborn", "Description": "This mod adds back content cut from the game from older versions of Minecraft as well as concepts and ideas that were never added or not yet added such as mobs, items, biomes and more.IceologerAbilities:Ice Block - He has the chance to summon ice on the players position and around him in a line, this ice is slippery and can make the player fall or run off the mountain or slow/block them temporarilySummon Polar Bears - He has the chance to summon 4 Hypnotized Polar Bears with red eyes that will fight for him and attack the playerLightning Strikes - He has the chance to summon 4 lightning strikes around the player's position that will set the ground on fireLoot:When he is defeated, he will drop the Ice Wand. This wand uses snowballs as its ammo and projectile and will create ice cubes (ice blocks) when it collides with any block on the ground. When the snowballs hit an animal or mob, it will knock them back very far as well as extinguishing them if they are on fire and removing any negative or positive potion effects on them (if they have Wither or poison or speed it will remove these like the player when he drinks milk).Glow SquidAbilities:When the player collides/touches the Glow Squid, it will give itself some potion effects as well as making it glow when panicking.When the player attacks the Glow Squid it will glow and fire its ink at the player, giving them the following negative potion effects: Slowness, Mining Fatigue, Nausea and Blindness.Loot:Glowing Ink Sac - Right clicking with this item equipped will give the player the following potion effects: Glowing IV, Night Vision IV and Water Breathing IV - mirroring the abilities and effects of the Glow Squid.Moobloom - Based off Minecraft mob vote mob. Watches Bees when nearby. Can be right clicked on to harvest dandelion flowers from it. Follows dandelions in the players hand. Can be bred using wheat plants. Spawns in flower forest biomes.Monster& Monstress - Based off the removed Steve \"Human\" mob from Minecraft Alpha and Beta. Added Alex female variant. Mobs spawn in Forests as passive/semi aggressive humans and drop sticks. Has baby variants.Man (Stillager) - Based off removed Steve Villager hybrid. Spawns in Forests, Taiga and most forest variants as a Hermit type mob that is passive and can interact with doors like a villager.Classic Zombie Pigman - Based off old Java Edition texture and MCPE Pigman texture. Is always hostile and spawns in the Nether.Killer Bunny - Variant of the already existent and unused Java rabbit type. Is hostile to the player and spawns only in the roofed forest biome.Rose - Readds original Rose that was replaced by the PoppyCyan Flower - Readds the blue flower typePaeonia - Adds smaller 1 block high version of the Paeonia flowerClassic - Adds a biome based on Minecraft Classic aka Alpha Edition with vibrant grass blocks and grass plants and leaves.Deep Warm Ocean - Adds unused deep warm ocean biome.Mountain Edge - Adds unused mountains edge biome.Ice Desert - Re-adds planned and removed frozen desert type biome.Crystallized Honey - Adds removed honey item to the game.

{"Title": "Desert Expansion", "Description": "Deserts are fun to explore, and in more recent times we've seen more additions such as Desert Temples and all new \"Husk\" zombie mobs. However, have you ever felt like the Vanilla Minecraft deserts are a little bland and could use an overhaul?The purpose of the \"Desert Expansion\" mod is to rebreathe life back into the Desert biomes (Desert and Desert Hills biomes) by adding all new content to them. This mod aims to introduce new plants, mobs, food, structures and more whilst still retaining the Minecraft Vanilla feeling and style.There's new crops added into the Desert in the mod in order to make it look less bland. These are the Desert Grass crops that spawn all around it so that its not just flat sand like Vanilla and also the newer Cactai variant added in a recent update to the mod, this is just a smaller plant variant of cactus that drops the same block but adds variation so there's two different types of the plant and makes the desert prettier.Rattle Snakes spawn in the Desert and Desert Hills biomes and spawn in groups of up to 4. They drop green dye and are aggressive when approached.Golden Eagles have now been fixed in the mod and fly around in the Desert Hills biomes, they are quite rare so it might be tough to find them, but if you want to unlock the secrets to the Pyramids inside the tombs, you'll need to hunt one of these birds because they drop the Shiny Golden Keys that unlock the Sarcophagus' in the Pyramids.Camels spawn in the Desert in small groups and wander around, they cannot be ridden with a saddle but add more immersion to the desert and can be good farm animals to capture in a stable in your village.Scorpions also spawn in Desert and Desert Hills. They are pretty tough and spawn in groups of 1-2. They are uncommon in the desert but do a fair bit of damage and they are pretty slow in speed so they don't pose too much of a threat when you create distance with them. They drop scorpion stingers.There is also a collection of structures in the mod. Some of these structures contain exclusive mobs in or around them that I didn't mention in the mobs list before as they only spawn in the structures and not in the desert itself. The first structure is the Pyramid which is a standard classic style pyramid constructed entirely of sandstone blocks, housing 1-2 mob spawners inside. These spawners spawn Jackal Guardian mobs that attack you and protect the tomb below. The top floor lures you in with loot in new pots, although if you find the way down below to the bottom floor, you'll enter the treasure room and tomb. If you defeat the guardians and destroy their spawners, you may be lucky as the Pyramids have the chance to contain lots of amazing loot inside, although they are rarer structures. This was inspired by Ancient Egypt and Archaology which I believe should be in Minecraft. Inside these Pyramids is a Tomb room housing a Sarcophagus with an undead Pharaoh inside! Get a golden key from killing a Golden Eagle and right click on a Sarcophagus to open it and awaken the Pharaoh Boss!There is also the Desert Oasis that has a rare chance to spawn in the desert and is a body of water surrounded by desert trees. This structure exclusively spawns desert tortoises all around it. This is a great place to use as a water source in the desert to drink or use for potions and other purposes, although they spawn rarely to simulate reality.There are also desert trees that spawn around the desert, which are semi common and spawn Ostriches all around them and below the trees in the shade. These Ostriches also spawn naturally in the Desert too although they are rarer.There are new Fossils that spawn around the Desert in the form of Skeletons, these are huge prehistoric dinosaur like structures made of bones. Bones have been used in the Nether and elsewhere for skeletons but they also are not used as much as they should be, so they're now implemented as huge jurassic skeletons littered over the desert, they're rare but add more depth to the biome.The last structure are Desert Farms which spawn in the Desert Hills biomes. These farms house 1 Farmer Villager who lives in a Sandstone house, with a bed and chests. Outside, there are crops such as wheat that are fully grown and stabled Cows which graze on the farmland in the stable. Sometimes, due to the intense sun of the desert, the crops can be found broken or already harvested on the ground, which can be collected. These farms can be used as houses or places as rest when starting a new world if you get lost in the desert or to use to trade with the farmers instead of finding a village.The mod adds a new food type which are found in the Oasises. The Oasis trees have coconuts hanging from them. You can cut the coconuts with an axe and right click on a block to crack the coconuts into cracked coconut pieces and then eat them as food which restores a fair level of hunger.", "Published time": "8/22/22 5:26 pm", "Views": 445, "Downloads": 46, "Credit": null, "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.15", "Tags": "New Content, Mobs, Biomes, Creatures, Mob, Biome, Bosses, Boss, Desert, Creature"},

A new powerpack and improved transmission gave it higher speed than the Centurion despite being heavier due to major upgrades to armour protection and the armament; this allowed it to replace both the Conqueror and Centurion while performing their roles effectively.

This takes inspiration from the Iceologer from Minecraft Dungeons along with community ideas and some of my own ideas. Abilities:Ice Block - He has the chance to summon ice on the players position and around him in a line, this ice is slippery and can make the player fall or run off the mountain or slow/block them temporarilySummon Polar Bears - He has the chance to summon 4 Hypnotized Polar Bears with red eyes that will fight for him and attack the playerLightning Strikes - He has the chance to summon 4 lightning strikes around the player's position that will set the ground on fire Loot:When he is defeated, he will drop the Ice Wand. This wand uses snowballs as its ammo and projectile and will create ice cubes (ice blocks) when it collides with any block on the ground. When the snowballs hit an animal or mob, it will knock them back very far as well as extinguishing them if they are on fire and removing any negative or positive potion effects on them (if they have Wither or poison or speed it will remove these like the player when he drinks milk).", "Published time": "8/22/22 5:28 pm", "Views": 472, "Downloads": 57, "Credit": null, "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.15", "Tags": "New Content, Items, Mobs, Biomes, Mob, Biome, Item, Bosses, Boss"},

{"Title": "Minecraft Filipino Language for Bedrock (Mina'tLikha Pure Tagalog)", "Description": "First Version of Mina'tLikha: New:(Latest)Remember:-- Some translation are not 100% accurate--- An untranslatable words have replaced with new nearly equal translation and self-creation translation-- Some Translation are copied from Minecraft Java 1.5(2015)🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵[ Preview ]Store and Character EditorOn previous Filipino Language pack in Bedrock(not mine), store/marketplace/profile had not translated in the game , In this add on you will get translation for these missing ones including their error messages, feedback and items. Some strings or texts are not translated as some there are controlled in internet not in system file and that is why my coded translation wont work or show up.🏴Terms:--- 🥇 \"Minabarya\" = Mine coinEmotes here is translated as \" Pag-Arte\" . If we translated back we get \" Acting\". As you can see the emotes namely \"Over there!\" are not translated because they came from internet , not on game file..🏴Terms:-- 🚩 Pag- Arte = Emote-- 🚩 Tauhan - Character (on newer version of Mina'tLikha it changed to KARAKTER)-- 🚩 Tagalikha - Creator🔴🔴🔴🟡🟡Loading Screen🔵🔵🔵🟡🟡When you enter the world , you will see this loading screen in Filipino version. Trivias and Tips Message are not working idk why - I already translated them but when I get in a game the message is still in English. Maybe I can fix this on future.🏴Terms:-- 🚩Mapagkukunan - Resource 🔴🔴🔴🔴🟡🟡Server and Settings🔵🔵🔵🔵🟡🟡Seems \" Sumali Serbiro\" is incorrect and weird for you. This is my two-word-translation method with a purpose to take quick read of the text. Eventhough the filipino entence rule always involves linking word such as ng, at,sa . I did \"Sumali Serbiro\" to read it quicklyWorld , Friends and Servers bar translated . But server names are not translatable , again, they are controlled in internet not game file.World settings translation plus their error message, status, and descriptionCheat Settings and Game RUles is not literally translated , i call this casual or kiddy translation(This is one of my self-translation) so the children or someone can easily understand the settings like for example \"Looting\" , I created my own translation which was its function \" Magtapon ang Nilalanng\" (The creature will drop) therefore the settings could easily determine its function through this translation method.🔴🔴🔴🟡🟡Interaction Buttonblue🟡🟡[[ Everything buttons are translated like \"Ride\" a horse(Umakya) , \" Trade\" in piglins (magpalitan) and more.🚩Upo - Sit ]] 🔴🔴🔴🔴🟡🟡Death Message🔵🔵🔵🔵🟡🟡Death Message is working for any entities like pet dies and player dies. Linking word rule is applied in this translation . Ex: pinatay ng %attacker si %victim⬆ Updated: Talupak - Husk🔴🔴🔴🔴🟡Editing Blocks🔵🔵🔵🔵🟡In operating command blocks , jigsaw blocks, structure blocks you will see that most of words are very deep and pure tagalog. As the title says , It's PURE tagalogFurnace , Crafting Table ,Dispenser and any container GUI Screen are completely translatedEnchantments translated in deep Tagalog , it to look like you are in Indigenous or reading Filipino Myths🔷 Updated: Pagrarahuyo to Pag Eengkanto🔴🔴🔴🔴🟡🟡Items and Blocks🔵🔵🔵🔵🟡🟡All potions are translated together with their effects that appears in hovering . Some effects and potion are the same in translation and some are not. Example : Potion of Feather falling(Pakpak) has an effect called Slow falling (Bagal Hulog) . YES, they have different TranslationSome translation is linked in dash symbol and this is my \"Clipping Method \" translation style. Where root words were added in order to connect the words and to produce effective meaning . 💡Term:🚩 Warped Fungus on a stick, is:Kiwalan Kabute- (unclipped)Kiwal na Kabute🚩Sculk Sensor , Kublim Tagramdam - (unclipped)Kubli Tagaramdam (literally means : Obscure-Sensor)Another translating syle is \" Remove Method\" where one vowel letter is removed to sound minecraftinized tagalog and quick to read and speak.💡Terms:🚩 Byak - Biyak(Crack) , ByakBato(Crack Stone) --> In Mina'tLikha it means \"Cobblestone\"Another method of translation is called \"Minecraftinize \" where one meaning is totally changed in order to get the equivalent term in a language. Let's take the \"Nether\" as an example. Nether means Underworld but in filipino it'll translated as Ibabang Mundo which is not appropriate to all nether items. So i create my minecraftinized tagalog term for Nether which is \"Impyerno\" literally means Hell . Btw, this idea was taken from Minecraft java 1.5 on 2015. Impyerno sounds evilish but approprite to use in nether items. We can say impyernong Piko(Nether Picaxe ) .However, Nether items in Mina'tLikha is combined in Minecraftinize and Clipping translation Method. 💡Terms:🚩 Netherrack - Impyersabitan (Impyernong Sabitan) 🚩 Nether Star - Impyerituin ( Impyernong Bituin)EXCLUDING - Kasuotang ImpyernoJust like what i said, some translation is not 100% accurate. There's no equivalent word for \" Dripstone\" because it is geologic word. Then , I apply my second style in translating - \" Word by word\" method . In caves and Cliffs Update I have applied WORD BY WORD METHOD . But no worries in this term because it still sounds good and ancient😆. It is still 80% correct becauseif you read aloud \"dripstone\" you can instantly mold the meaning in your mind that dripstone is a bato(stone) that patak(drips) water on it.The most.. longest .. Translation are these iron stuffs. Because we have different forms in iron like \"Waxed\" \" Weathering\" and \" Cut \" and their also building forms like \" Stairs \" and \" Slabs\". In Copper item forms, translation was made in \"Clipping MethodThe term \"Kulog\" literally means \"Thunder\" and this translation word was taken up from Minecraft Java 1.5 version . \"Panakwil\" Means resistor in electronics.🧲 Recall: Minecraftinize MethodOne type of Minecraftinize Method is Derivation Method . It is more deep, hidden and confusing to understand than those Minecratinize Terms. Lets take an example : The Ghast . Ghast is spelled almost like \"Ghost\" but the difference is the vowel. To translate in tagalog, we derive the word Ghast to ghost since ghost has meaning in filipino which is \"Multo\" , but the translation should follow in derivation method, since ghost(multo) is o vowel in ghast. then Ghast could be \"Multa\" in Mina'tLikha. This is one of funny trabslation i had encounter hahaKilabot means \"Creepy \" or that frightens you . Again, this word was taken up from Minecraft 1.5 Java version.🔴🔴🔴🔴🟡🟡🟡Command Feedback Message🔵🔵🔵🔵🟡🟡🟡Command description , usage and feedbacks are 100% translated.

Soul sand and three wither skulls? You're building a Wither!\"—Jesse to Ivor about the Wither Storm. (Determinant) srcThe Wither Storm, is an enormous mutated wither that served as the main antagonist for the first four episodes of Season 1 of Minecraft: Story Mode.It was created by Ivor through the use of the Command Block, three wither skulls, and soul sand which was later destroyed in the conclusion of the fourth episode, A Block and a Hard Place. It was programmed to follow Gabriel the Warrior's amulet. However, due to some mishaps, it became out of control and unstoppable, destroying everything in the way of the amulet.It was destroyed by Jesse's Gang in \"A Block and a Hard Place\".Contents1Overview1.1Appearance1.2Abilities2Killed Victims3Death3.1Killed By4Trivia5Gallery6Site NavigationOverviewAppearanceWhen created, the Wither Storm appeared to be a regular Wither with a Command Block within its chest. Though as it began to pull in the surrounding blocks, it quickly transformed into a gigantic, black creature with long, powerful tentacles, and along with its three heads. With each head comes one blueish purple, glowing eye and a large set of mandibles. The Wither Storm was also made of mostly obsidian, with a nether brick interior, and quartz teeth.While the Wither Storm still held some of the similarities as a normal wither, it contained a few enderman-esque qualities as well, because it was used to erase the Ender Dragon out of existence. The tractor beam was able to pull blocks and objects towards itself. The ability can be compared to the abilities of the endermen. Both were able to manipulate a block's location without tools or breaking it, similar to how an enderman can pick up any block. The Wither Storm's eyes were also purple; the associated color of the End.At the end of \"The Last Place You Look\", the Wither Storm was split into three separate entities. Two of them resembled slightly smaller versions of the original. The other one was the main Wither Storm monster; it had the largest body and held the command block inside.AbilitiesThe Wither Storm was a very powerful creature. It gained its extraordinary capabilities with the help of the Command Block. Its powers were:Firing Wither Skulls that explode violently on contact, leaving behind an accumulation of flames.Using a tractor beam to pull in any entity, block, and person within it. Being left in the beam for too long can inflict people with Wither or Wither Sickness.Using its several tentacles to break through any block (including Obsidian) and to attack from a distance.Possessing an immense degree of durability as it is shown to have survived the detonation of the Formidi-Bomb at point-blank range.Regeneration, as long as the Command Block was intact.Splitting and creating progenies of itself if separated into pieces once linked to the original. If the original Wither Storm who had Command Block dies, its progenies die along with it.Forming and activating additional heads as well as tentacles inside its body cavity to protect the Command Block inside.Tracking the Order's Amulet unless it is in the Nether or the End.Killed VictimsThe list below shows the victims the Wither Storm has killed:Magnus the Rogue (Determinant).Ellegaard the Redstone Engineer (Determinant).Reuben (Indirectly).Several Hostile Mobs.Possibly a few Humans (indirectly).DeathKilled ByJesseReuben (assisted)The Wither Storm was powered by the Command Block, so to defeat it, Jesse used an enchanted weapon (with Command Block powers) to destroy the Command Block. Reuben helped by retrieving the enchanted weapon for Jesse and bringing it to them, though endangering himself in the process. This defeated the Wither Storm and assured it would never reanimate back to life.TriviaThe Wither Storm is the first major antagonist in the series and the first antagonist to be created by a person.The second antagonist created by a person is PAMA.Although it's possible PAMA was the first one to be created chronologically.It is also the first non-human major antagonist, the second being PAMA.The Wither Storm cannot be built in normal Minecraft, though all of the materials needed to build one exist.The terms \"Witherstorm\" and \"Wither Storm\" are interchangeable; in fact, both terms were used to refer to it in Minecraft: Story Mode. The former was used in episodes 1 and 2, and the latter was used in episodes 3, 4, and 5.When the Wither Storm's middle head mutated, its eye color changed to cyan, in contrast to its main color, purple.In \"Hero in Residence\", several posters of The Wither Storm are seen throughout Beacontown.The Wither Storm is the first antagonist to have an antagonistic role for more than one episode, the other being Romeo.The Wither storm is the only main antagonist with no dialogue.In some of the TV spots for the 2021 film, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Cletus Kasady’s symbiote, Carnage, uses roars of the Wither Storm.There is an extremely well made mod known as Cracker's Wither Storm which adds The Wither Storm into Minecraft, including withered mobs, Command Block Tools, withered blocks and even config settings. This isn't the first time The Wither Storm was put in a mod, an older mod known as Engender adds it too, but is not as impressive.", "Published time": "9/21/22 8:14 pm", "Views": 852, "Downloads": 236, "Credit": "Telltale Games & Mojang Stuoes", "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.16.5", "Tags": "Program"},

The better you do, and the rarer the material, the better loot you'll get- go too far though, and you'll be rewarded with nothing whatsoever.Over 91 unique Ceramic Pots and Porcelain Vases; in addition to providing a unique storage solution, each type comes in sixteen different colors, and three different shapes- colored ceramic shards can exclusively be obtained through trade and archeology, and every single ceramic pot has a unique illustration... possibly with lore implications, if you're so inclined.A wide variety of Gadgets and Gizmos, including double-jump chestplates, power tools, ore detectors, a wide assortment of energy blasters, and plenty more to boot!Plenty of other miscellaneous features, including unique spears, music discs, elemental items, a new mineral obtained exclusively through lightning, and, just as a side note, Copper Golems, (at least, my interpretation of them), which should still be just as adorable as you would hope!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For more detailed information about the different mechanics, decorations, weapons/tools, golems, totems, music discs, etc; be sure to check out the Curseforge page!

It adds hundreds of Buildings, NPCs to do many jobs, such as Builders, Bakers, Butchers, Farmers, Lumberjacks, Cheesemakers, and many more.The mod is suited to different play styles. If you want to make a quaint little village, go ahead. If you want to build a sprawling city, knock yourself out!There are multiple gamemodes for the mod. Normal mode allows you to grow an economy, and build your city from the ground up. Creative grants you unlimited money and building materials.Now with multiplayer support! The mod will continue development on 1.12.2 until enough features have been added to warrant an update to other Minecraft versions.Getting StartedCrafting recipes are the same as older versions of Sim-U-Kraft, and can be found on the old Wiki. In order to start the mod, you must first craft a Constructor Block and place it. Interacting with the block will allow you to pick your gamemode and continue with the mod.InstallationTo install, simply download and install Minecraft Forge, and place the Sim-U-Kraft Reloaded jar file into the mods folder.

Phantoms can spawn up to three at a time in a nestHere is what each nest looks like:\\/ Large \\/\\/ Medium \\/\\/ Small \\/Exhaustion System:There is a whole new system in place for Phantom spawning, the two-step Exhaustion system1. Upon entering the End, you will get a 15-minute effect called \"Exertion\"While your player has Exertion phantoms will leave you alone acting as a sort of buffer for you to kill the Ender dragon, collect shuckers, or grab some chorus fruit to make the new potion \"Potion of brief renewal\"Phantom will still spawn, but won't target any players with ExertionYou can see how much time you have left by a scoreboard on your action bar2. When your Exertion runs out, you will be granted a new effect called \"Exhaustion\"You and any other players will be alerted when a player is exhausted via the chatWhen your player has Exhaustion any phantoms will attack you whenever you are in their sightThe only current way to remove Exhaustion is to rest on a bed in the Overworld. When you hop onto your bed to rest, a progress bar will appear to show you how much time you have to rest before you aren't Exhausted anymorePotions:In Phantom Overhaul, two new potions have been added allowing you to increase your exertionThere are two potions Potion of brief renewal and Potion of brief renewal II, giving 4 and 8 extra minutes of exertion respectivelyThey are brewed with popped chorus fruit and an awkward potion in a brewing standExperimental Toggles:Important: This Addon will NOT work if you enable Upcoming Creator FeaturesThree Experimental toggles are required for this pack to function correctly:Holiday Creator FeaturesCustom BiomesMolang FeaturesGametest Framework is optional, but not required for Phantom OverhaulKnown Issues:There is an incompatibility with some Brewing UI Packs, nothing game-breaking, but the UI will be messed upPlanned Features:Porting the Pack over to the new Execute Syntax whenever I learn it ;-;ImportantThis is a Bedrock edition Add-on, It will not work on Java EditionYou may NOT create your own Mediafire link, Please always share a link to this PMC page insteadYou may not use any of my code without direct permission from mePlease credit me if you use my pack in a video, showcase, or article of any sortPlease ask before using this mod in any public modpack (I will most likely always say yes, but still ask!)This Add-on doesn't use player.json so it will work with most any other packThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.", "Published time": "8/28/22 5:29 pm", "Views": 903, "Downloads": 37, "Credit": "Tacman215 for the Idea, All the help, and the updated Phantom nests!", "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.19", "Tags": "New Content, End, Bedrock, Phantom, Bedrockedition, Phantoms, Bedrockaddon, Phantomoverhaul, Phantomrework, Endphantoms, Phantomnests, Updatedend"},

In this mod's the bedrock floor is at Y -511, meaning - from Y -511 to Y -255 your screen will not flicker. Anything above that point (Y -256 to Y 1024) is not Optifine friendly.

You might also find Signs, Redstone torches, and Pyramids with Redstone torches on top of them around your world randomly.Originally after doing research and debugging I came to the conclusion that Herobrine was actually just a mob bug in early Alpha. It was known that mobs would sometimes despawn within a 20-30 block distance from the player in front of their eyes, such as zombies (you can see this yourself on early alpha builds!) which sometimes would be mistaken as Herobrine. Herobrine was basically a \"bug\" entity which would appear in your game then disappear while making small changes to your world.I've come across many Herobrine mods myself which are either unrealistic by making him a boss or too obvious with events happening way too often.In this mod, you start your world normally, and things don't start happening right away... Over time you will notice weird things within your map, and if you do get lucky, you might even see Herobrine yourself!

It's easy, just search for darkness!Then, watch out to don't step (or if you do, you get the advancement) on the corrupted blocks. They spread fast and can corrupt your house if they just touch it.You'll find some green flowers over there generating, that just go up even if there's sunlight. Why?Then you wanna dig the rotten corrupted blocks (those brown ones that generate replacing the black) in order to get fragments to make a decorruptionizator.That monstrosity will make your path thru the brown more fun. Just right-click a rotten corrupted block and have fun!In the Nether's depths, there's a red block waiting to be loaded (by non-spectator players) to spread. Find it in the big chambers and have nightmares!On the floating islands in the end, you'll find some of them yellow, some purple with a blue thing on them and some rotten with blue blocks floating. That's because of the purpur variant of the virus.When you get to a structure in the black biome and you have enough flowers and wool, craft that holy thing and light the frame there!You'll find yourself in the best biome, but also the worst.

Select 'y' and set the Axis Preference to '0.80' or above.To move around:set the camera to \"Movement\" mode: press the Tab key or hold down the mouse right buttonMove the mouse to look aroundPress W to move forwardMore about camera controls in the voxel editor’s help menu: Help > Tutorial > Cameras and Help > Controls Documentation > Camera ControlsHow Minecraft blocks are represented in Avoyd, and how to modify themAvoyd does not use textures, but the materials used in Avoyd match the Minecraft default materials as closely as possible: their colour is based on Minecraft textures averages and they have specular reflection and emissive properties where relevant (water, glass, metal, lava…).Since version 0.8.0, torches, lava etc voxels emit light when rendered. Likewise, metals, water, glass etc. reflect light.Since version 0.8.8, materials transparency (water, glass) is supported in the CPU path traced Renderer (available through Menu Render).Each block and most of their variations are mapped to a material in Avoyd. We've mapped the vast majority of Minecraft Java Edition blocks to the appropriate materials settings in AvoydFor Minecraft versions prior to 1.13 (the flattening) we now use both both block Id and data value to assign the correct namespace Id to a an imported block. For versions post 1.13 we directly use the namespace Id providedSince Avoyd version 0.8.0 you can view the Minecraft namespace Id of every block imported as an Avoyd materialTo edit the Minecraft materials individually in Avoyd, open menu Tools > Materials... and choose ‘Minecraft’ from the Material Type drop-down. Click on a colour swatch to edit the material properties. You can also access the materials from the Palette in Tools > Edit Tool…You can make specific block types (for example barrier) invisible in renders by making the material entirely transparent. In Tools > Materials, select the material and set its parameters as follows:Colour = White (R=255 G=255 B=255)Metallic = 0Smooth = 0Emissive = 0Surface Transmission = 1Absorption Length = 1,048,576Scatter Length = 1,048,576Phase = 0If you want to reuse your material alterations in other maps, save them as a template in File > Save/Load Templates > Materials. After you've imported a new Minecraft map, load your materials template and it will overwrite the defaults.How to change the scene lighting and atmosphereOpen the ‘Light and Atmosphere’ window: menu Tools > Light and Atmosphere… video exampleTo change the position of the light source, modify the parameter 'Light Direction'. Note the UI is evolving: we will make it easier to use in future releases.Quickly change how bright or foggy the lighting is using the presets: white light, dawn, sunny, sunset and clear atmosphere, haze or fog. You can also adjust the parameters manually using the light and atmosphere settings.Your can save our settings as templates to reuse in other worlds in Avoyd: use File > Save/Load Template > Light and Atmosphere...How to render a Minecraft map using AvoydOnce you’ve imported the map, find the scene you want to render and adjust the lightingOpen menu ‘Render’Click ‘Preview’ for a quick renderAdjust the image size, depth of field and other parametersWhen you’re happy with the scene, click ‘Do Raytrace Scene’Click ‘Accumulate’ to run the raytracing again and increase the quality of the render. Note that after several accumulations the result will stop improvingWhen you’re satisfied with the result you can denoise the render to remove artefacts (small dots)Finally, save the imageTutorial video for doing a render of a world and transriptLimitationsYou cannot re-export any edits made in Avoyd back to Minecraft nor MagicaVoxelAvoyd only supports Minecraft Java Edition maps. It does not support Bedrock.Avoyd doesn’t currently support schematics importAvoyd does not use textures nor block models so all the Minecraft decorations, half-blocks, steps, objects such as torches etc. appear as full voxel blocks made of a single material in Avoyd. The materials used in Avoyd match the Minecraft default materials as closely as possible using textures averages with added reflective and emissive properties. You can modify the default materials properties in Avoyd by opening menu Tools > Materials.It is currently not possible to hide block types in Avoyd: you have to delete them manually using the Edit Tool, or make the block type invisible (see tips section) before you render the scene. We intend to add block hiding in the future.Avoyd only runs on Windows PCTips and tricksOnce imported, save the Minecraft map as an Avoyd world file. This will enable you to open it faster and use it as a paste brush.To learn the basics of editing in Avoyd, we recommend you follow the step by step tutorial under menu Help > Tutorial and watch the basics of editing video. The user interface has evolved since but it's very close and it is still a good place to start.Tune the Graphics properties under Settings > Graphics. Increasing the 'LOD change distance' improves detail in the distance but reduces performance.All controls and keyboard shortcuts are listed in menu Help > ControlsEnable tooltips from menu View > Show TooltipsCheck the size of the world and add notes from menu View > World PropertiesLight or Dark mode UI, adjust font size etc. in menu Settings > DisplaySkip the main menu when opening Avoyd: in Settings > System, set “Start As” to “Voxel Editor”For further help see Avoyd News and Support forumIf you imported Minecraft worlds into a version of Avoyd older than 0.8.10, you should install the latest version of Avoyd and import again to ensure the latest transparent materials are used.CreditsScreenshots and renders gallery and videos feature:Atropos by carlooooCuirassé DSD-401 by MrBatouDrehmal: PRIMORDIAL by BalderichGreenfield City by THEJESTRKing's Landing and more by WesterosCraftMattupolis by mattuFINThanks to shadowESH for their feedback", "Published time": "1/29/21 2:20 pm", "Views": 16486, "Downloads": 1897, "Credit": "Screenshots gallery features Minecraft maps: Atropos by @carloooo, Cuirassé DSD-401 by @MrBatou, Drehmal: PRIMORDIAL by @Balderich, Greenfield City by @THEJESTR, King's Landing by @WesterosCraft,  Mattupolis by @mattuFIN", "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.18.1", "Tags": "Program, Editor, Importer, Render, Rendered, Rendering, Viewer, Voxel, Exporter"},

At the time of release, this mod will become very large-scale in terms of the amount of content added to the gameIn the course of how I will refine this mod, I will change the parameters of many weapons: their damage, durability, etc. For some weapons, I will add special properties and effects. And of course I will add the other 124 weapons, including all 3D weapons, all dual blades, all bows and crossbows. I also have an idea to make a unique attack animation separately for each weapon.Many items that this mod adds have a texture with a resolution of more than 16x16 pixels, and in order for them to be displayed correctly in Minecraft, I made a 3D model separately for each of these items.All the items this mod adds can be crafted and obtained in survival mode.

{"Title": "Affinity [Bedrock Edition]", "Description": "NOTE: You will need BOTH the Behavior Pack (BP) and the Resource Pack (RP) for the mod to work properly.Installation Instructions:-Via .MCPack(s)Download both the BP and RP packs, double click to open and automatically install each individually-Via .MCAddon/zip(If it is a .zip then rename it to change the extension to \".mcaddon\")Double click to open and automatically install both the Behavior Pack (BP) and Resource Pack (RP)Create a new world with:-The RP and BP for Affinity enabled-\"Holiday Creator Features\" enabled-\"Upcoming Creator Features\" enabled-\"Molang Features\" enabled-\"Custom Biomes\" enabled (required for ores to spawn)(Those last four are in the \"Experimental\" category)Affinity is inspired by the in-depth and vast experience of Java modpacks. Focused on the concept of Affinity this mod is meant to be an ever expanding experience that enhances the normal gameplay of Minecraft in unique waysYour adventure begins with searching the caves for a strange glowing ore...Everything in this mod pack is obtained via the interactions that thisstrange new material has with the world you're familiar with.Affinity OreCrude AffinityOnce you've obtained your first shard you can build a Crude Affinity Tool using one of the four \"Core\" materials. (Coal, Iron, Gold, or Diamond)These \"Crude\" tools have all the advantages of true Affinity tools... except for durability, try not to break them before you can enhance them into their proper form.The main usage of these tools is to help you extract additional Affinity shards from ore and give an early-game source of additional ore drops.They can even (rarely) cause an Affinity Shard to drop from normal ores...True AffinityOnce you have gathered sufficient materials you can enhance your crude tool to a True Affinity Pickaxe. These tools have infinite durability and resonate with the materials they're made from to grant extra drops. However, they cannot be used to break any blocks they lack affinity for. See the chart at the bottom for a list of what each tool (and tool variant) can mine.Further tool upgradesInfusion CraftingThese infusions supercharge existing tools with the following effects (each tool can only have one or the other)Lapis Infused: Significant bonus drops from ores, better chances for Affinity Shard drops from matching ores, bonus Lapis Affinity (With a chance to get Lapis Essence)Redstone Infused: Bonus drops from ores, slightly better chances for Affinity Shard drops, bonus Redstone Affinity, a chance to get the Essences of any matching ore.Ore Essences and CrystalsYou can obtain Essences by mining ores with the tools shown belowAll essences can be combined with Silica (see \"Resonant Tools\" for how to obtain) to create Crystal SeedsThese seeds can be planted on stone to grow special crystalline forms of each material.Once fully grown they can be harvested to recover the seeds as well as a Crystal Shard.Each shard can be smelted in a blast furnace, often to recover the initial material.(When obtained in-game the shards have lore text explaining their usage)This makes Affinity Shards, Iron, Gold, and Diamonds renewable through this method.Resonant ToolsAffinity shards naturally repel anything unlike themselves. It seems that this can be used to make tools that rapidly deconstruct most natural materials.First you'll need to craft a Resonance CoreThis core, when combined with a given material, will vibrate at the resonant frequency of that material.Not only can this be used for rapidly gathering said material, it can also sometimes drop special items that cannot otherwise be found...Stone/Diorite/Andesite/GraniteNOTE: This \"Resonant Stone Pickaxe\" is a special case, it can be crafted with any normal type of stone (Diorite, Andesite, Granite, and Stone) and will be able to mine ANY of those no matter how it was crafted. It however, CANNOT mine DeepslateObsidian and DeepslateDirt, Gravel, and SandNOTE: The Resonant Shovel (Sand) can cause Silica to drop from Sand! This is the only way to obtain the necessary silica to create Crystal SeedsTrees**Can be upgraded with a Cascading Resonance Core (see \"Cascading Tools\" below)(NEW IN v1.1) Cascading ToolsAdvances in research into the resonance effect of Affinity Crystals has led to a powerful innovation. The final upgrade tier of Affinity Tools: Cascading ResonanceThese tools cause blocks mined with them to emit a shockwave that propagates to any blocks of the same type nearby, breaking them and transporting their drops to the tool's holder. Each block broken continues the shockwave until no more can be found. This process has been dubbed Veinmining.To create one of these powerful tools you will first need a Redstone or Lapis Infused tool (See \"Tool Upgrades\") and a Cascading Resonance CoreThis core can be combined with any Infused Affinity Tool, see chart belowIt can also be combined with the Resonant Axe to create a tool able to fell entire trees in a single swing...Tool Compatibility ChartNeed help or want to be notified when updates arrive?

{"Title": "Call to Battle 2", "Description": " Experience the world of Call to Battle 2, a mod transporting you back to the Second World War Striving for a realistic infantry experience, Call to Battle2 presents detailed models and combat mechanics.It is based around historical, asymmetrical combat across all fronts of the war. Call to Battle2 brings back not only the nostalgic experience of America vs. Germany, but hopes to bring countries not observed by conventional games.FeaturesCall to Battle2 has a large variety of features that lead to intense, realistic firefights. Here are some of the main ones:Realistic, Smooth gunplayCall to Battle2 strives for realistic gunplay without lag. Each of the over 50 guns is carefully crafted to represent the original. Damage is based on the gun's caliber and calculated based on where you hit the enemy, including heart shots. Crouching, proning, melee attacks, and much more are also possible with Call to Battle2!An array of attachments also exist, if you have an applicable gun you can outfit it with bayonets, scopes, bipods, and more. Unlike most games scopes don't zoom your whole screen in, just the actual scope, and they even allow you to still switch and use ironsights on them! Machine Guns can be bipoded onto a block, or placed in a strategic position. Depending on the Rocket used, a Rocket Launcher can penetrate through a wall before exploding, and flamethrowers burst up flames when they hit a block. So much more in-depth features exist in Call to Battle2, find out for yourself! Game ModesCall to Battle2 contains multiple game modes to play with the community. While a simple, easy-to-setup singleplayer mode will be available, you can play these game modes with the rest of the community on the official server!AssaultAssault involves one team pushing into enemy territory and trying to conquer it. Each base has a garrison amount, that if depleted will result in the loss of the base. The attacking side can also capture these bases by simply securing the area. The goal of the defenders is to push back the enemy assault and prevent them from securing the territory.EngagementEngagement is a mode where two nations fight for control over the entire territory. Each side will have to simultaneously protect their own bases, while attempting to capture the enemy bases. A nation wins when they capture the entire territory, or eliminate the enemy presence in the area.WarzoneWarzone is a all-out war mode where there are capturable points all around the map. Holding points contributes to your teams victories, as do enemy casulties to a lesser extent. It is a non-linear mode where any base can be captured at any time!Other ModesIn the near future we will be releasing other modes as well! Currently planned are escort, convoy, and sabatoge. Stay tuned for more information!Destruction PhysicsIn Call to Battle2 explosions are not only deadly to soldiers, they are devastating to the environment. Rockets, satchel charges, as well as artillery can all bring structures crashing to the ground if they take out it's supports. The debris is also very dangerous, watch out!Do you really love Call to Battle?You can Donate through PayPal!

Think about it, there isn't much use for it really. There's no point wasting your gold on tools, swords and armor. How many clocks do you need when you can just look at the sun. And if you need gold nuggets to make potions, all it takes is one gold ingot and you already have nine. Do you wish there were better things to do with your gold? Or maybe if you could exchange it for something else?Now there's a block that makes gold worth mining. It's called the Lucky Block, and can be crafted with 8 gold ingots and a dropper, and can also be found naturally in your world. When you mine this block it will have an equal chance of dropping items, spawning entities or structures.WARNING: If luck is not on your side, this block may have devastating effects on you or your world. It is recommended that you backup your world, use a not important world or go hardcore and take the risk.CraftingCraftingIncrease/decrease luck by crafting with the items below:~ Add ~Diamond: 12Diamond Block: 100Emerald: 8Emerald Block: 80Gold Ingot: 6Gold Block60Iron Ingot: 3Iron Block: 30Golden Apple: 40Enchanted Golden Apple: 100Nether Star: 100~ Subtract ~Rotten Flesh; -5Spider Eye: -10Fermented Spider Eye: -20Poisonous Potato: -10Puffer Fish: -20Downloading and InstallingDownload the Lucky Block from the official website using the download button in the top-right.For Minecraft Forge:Download the Forge installerDownload the Lucky Block and place it in your mods folderFor FabricMC:Download the Fabric installerDownload the Fabric API and place it in your mods folderDownload the Lucky Block and place it in your mods folderAdd-onsAdd-ons are user-made additions to the Lucky Block.

{"Title": "Necrotic Sword of DOOOOM!!!", "Description": "Are you itching for a challenge that will make you go \"Who in their right mind would ever go out of their way to do this?\" Then you've come to the right place. Those looking to join the dozens around the world, myself included, who had undertaken the harrowing journey that is the creation of a weapon so complicated it literally drove some people insane, look no further! For the Necrotic Sword of Doom has arrived!With it's multitude of buffs and abilities, this hero slaying sword replaces any need for friends, as you will lose them all in your failing attempt to obtain it.Are you really ready for this?Crafting recipes within crafting recipes await you if you decide to take on this mind destroying challenge. HOWEVER! Everything you will undergo is not something that hasn't been done before, many times as a matter of fact. To any fans of AQW, you know the suffering of the void aura grind, and now a new community will know that suffering too. Or not, because I doubt anyone will ever actually legitimately make this thing. If you're truly serious about attempting to craft this diabolical weapon of destruction, I suggest not attempting to do it all in one go, just do it passively over time.Understanding the processThe creation of this sword is broken down into the creation of 5 extremely grindy pieces. This includes the Necrotic blade, Necrotic hilt, Necrotic aura, Doom heart, and 800 void aura. To give you an example of how difficult this will be, here is the crafting process for just ONE void aura.First you need to create void essence. Then you take 8 of these essences and imbue some blaze powder with them.And boom! That's one void aura. So one of these bad boys will require at LEAST 16 spiders, 8 skeletons, and 8 zombies (unless you're using looting, hint hint). And that's assuming they drop the maximum yield possible every time. The total amount of void aura needed to complete the sword numbers over seven thousand. Beginning to doubt yourself? Don't worry, I did too. This doesn't even include the over 10000 undead energy needed, or all the other difficult to obtain drops. Is this worth it?Probably not, unless this mod gets somewhat big and people start some race to complete it or something. If you plan on using this sword in tandem with other mods, I didn't balance it at all for that stuff, so it deals 500 damage, and has buffs and abilities that require little to no micromanaging, such as self heals, killing for speed buffs, that sorta thing. Basically, it gives the old big bertha a run for her money.Still interested?If you made it this far with actual desire to have and complete this, then you will find the complete set of 39 recipes in the link below. I wish you the best of luck, for your social life and for your sanity.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eH6b8UXWsiUevKaS_6x6pAawEl38u9XqgNlxUh2tZtk/edit?usp=sharing(I posted this mod on cursed forge earlier but their review thingy is taking so long)Oh and yes, feel free to put this in mod packs, although I'm not sure why you would.", "Published time": "9/23/22 11:16 pm", "Views": 704, "Downloads": 40, "Credit": null, "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.18.1", "Tags": "New Content, Farm, Sword, Challenge, Difficulty, Insanity, Grind"},

{"Title": "AOE Arrows - mc 1.19", "Description": "There are 7(+2) arrows, currently that work in this structure....Zeus, and Yeet both have switches that you can use to set smaller or larger radius clouds. Even though it looks like it's on, you need to flip the switch back and forth to get it to register the first time you load this structure.Zeus creates a large aoe cloud that Summons lightning on any @e and sets weather to thunder Yeet gives @e lev 99 for 1 sec.Cake makes a cake, clears the weather, and gives a health buff and fills your hunger bar.Tnt Summons Tnt @eGhost gives wither, glowing and invisibility. Kind of cool combo, kills just about everything eventuallyPortal teleports to the basement of the structure. It also sorts cows, chickens, pigs, and sheep into the back yard. It sends mobs and other entities to an inescapable torture machine in the basement.There are two other portal arrows avaliable, but the locations are hard coded into the blocks, so I don't know where they will teleport you in your world. You can edit the location for each in the command block. You'll see the ones with the signs on them. 3rd floor.Hindrance gives blindness while you're in the cloud, and nausea for 30 sec after you get out--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is an nbt file generated using in-game structure blocks. It contains a multi-story house with 3 levels of arrows, and some awesome gear on the top floor. It was made to be a reward house for survival mode. I intend to add on to this in the future. The portal arrows now work based on reletive locations, which means they sort cow's, pigs, sheep and chickens to the back yard (byo fence) and all non player mobs into a torture device that they cannot escape. This machine relies on a mine cart going in circles to trigger it. You might need to give it a push after you first load the file. It's in the basement.Do not rotate the structure or the relative locations will not work. Also, dig 7 blocks down and place the structure block to get the front door lined up right. Unzip the file, and place it in.../minecraft/saves/(your_world_name)/generated/minecraft/structures/(file Here)-If you do not have a \"generated\" folder, it's just because you've never used a structure block in that world. You should load the world, and save a small structure so minecraft generates the file hierarchy before moving on to the next step. I've also just made the folders myself and it's worked just fine as well.Go into that world and get a structure block(/give @p structure_block)use the structure block to load \"mothership1-119-d7\" (or whatever the filename is, without \".nbt\" at the end)If you are a \"rick\" or a \"morty\" you are immune to all negative effects of the arrowsThere is a command block that will teleport you to the front door if you don't have the tag \"rick\" or \"morty\" and you try and come in. You need the tag \"rick\" to go up to the second floor to get arrows. You have to sacrifice a netherite block for Rick status, or a Gold block for Morty status. You only have to do this once per world. You can access the space to place the block near the front door.Bypass this with the command \"/tag <playername> add rick\"Each arrow has one block that gives you the arrow (the one connected to the button), and a series of command blocks which carry out the functions. You can tweak the numbers in those command blocks to get a bigger radius on an are of effect cloud, or a longer effect. Have fun, if you mess it up, you can always reload it. I have put labels on one of the sets of arrows to indicate what each block does. These are general guides, and all the arrows follow the same basic format. This is to help anyone who wants to tweak them.On the top floor is some overpowered gear. All diamond. The crossbow shoots ridiculously fast. And has tri shot.There are two sets of pants, one gives high jump lvl 5 while worn. That relies on a set of command blocks also on the top floor. If those command blocks aren't loaded (if the structure isn't in the spawn chunk) then the jump boost won't work, as with all the other armor perks.Diamond chestplate gives mega health buff while worn.Two types of special boots. One set gives you super speed, the other is so cold that anything the wearer steps on turns to ice, including air.As long as the structure is in your spawn chunk, then the arrows and armor will work anywhere in the world. If you place this structure outside of the spawn chunk, then the arrows and gear will only work when the chunk containing the structure is loaded (ie, you're near it)", "Published time": "8/8/22 9:23 pm", "Views": 771, "Downloads": 125, "Credit": null, "Progress": "100% complete", "Game Version": "Minecraft 1.19", "Tags": "Armor, Magic, Weapon, Effects, Equipment, Commandblock, Arrow, Magical, Newcontent, Arrows, Other, Structureblock, Vanillamod, Areofeffect, Aoe"},
