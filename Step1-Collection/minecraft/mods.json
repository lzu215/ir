{"Title": "STAR WARS ARC–170 ADD-ON [Bedrock edition]", "Description": ["The ARC-170 fighter-bomber was the result of the joint development of Incom and Subpro corporations. It was developed at the beginning of the Clone Wars and began entering the Republican Navy in the first year of the war, becoming the first multifunctional fighter in the Grand Army of the Republic", "The fighter is controlled by three people – the pilot, the weapons operator and the gunner. Due to the extensive range of weapons, an armament operator was included in the crew of the ARC-170, the presence of which made it possible to aim missiles more efficiently and not distract the pilot from the direct control of the fighter. Due to the relatively low maneuverability, which was much inferior to most of the KNS fighter droids, it required the presence of a side-gunner covering the rear hemisphere. Due to the presence of a hyperdrive, an astrodroid was also included in the crew, whose tasks included navigation and calculating coordinates for hyperjumping.", "One of the technological innovations used (see note) was the sliding S-wings. They are aerodynamic planes that improve the stabilization of the vehicle in the atmosphere, which allows the ARC-170 to conduct an effective air battle in planetary space and carry out equally effective strikes on ground targets. In addition, the S-wings remove excess heat generated by the engines and are projectors of the protective field. By the way, in terms of security, the ARC-170 could only be compared with the no less perfect, heavy fighter-bomber BTL-B Y-Wing.", "The presence of powerful sensors, a hyperdrive and a long flight range (by the way, five times more than the legendary X-wing) made it possible to use the ARC-170 as a long-range scout.", "During the Clone Wars, ARC-170 squadrons inflicted great damage to the separatist fleet, taking part in both small long-range raids and major battles. During the Battle of Coruscant – one of the final battles of the Clone Wars – the ARC-170 squadron, under the command of a clone named Davijaan (call sign \"Odd Ball\"), covered Obi-Wan and Anakin who were breaking through to the separatist flagship. Later, the same squadron dealt a significant blow to some ships of the KNS fleet. It was with ARC-170 cannons, the clone pilot Jai'galaar (Jai'galaar) over Kato Neimoidia that the Delta-7 Plo Kuna was shot down, during the execution of \"Order 66\".", "The resulting Galactic Empire made full use of the technology inherited from it. The only external difference between the Imperial ARC-170 was the color. Now the sides of the ARC-170 have lost the variegated colors and individual emblems that they could boast of during the Clone Wars; all fighters have been repainted in light gray with imperial markings. It is not known exactly how long the ARC-170 was in service with the Imperial Navy.", "Subsequently, the experience gained during the creation and use of the ARC-170 was used in the development of the legendary X-Wing fighter", "Available on Minecraft version 1.17 and higher", "Истребитель-бомбардировщик ARC-170 был результатом совместной разработки корпораций Инком и Субпро. Он был разработан в начале Войны Клонов и начал поступать в республиканский флот в первый год войны, став первым многофункциональным истребителем в ВАР.", "Истребителем управляют три человека – пилот, оператор вооружения и бортстрелок. Из-за обширной номенклатуры оружия, в состав экипажа ARC-170 был включен оператор вооружения, наличие которого позволяло эффективнее наводить и ракеты и не отвлекать, тем самым, пилота от непосредственного управления истребителем. Из-за относительно невысокой маневренности, сильно уступавшей большинству дроидов-истребителей КНС, потребовалось наличие бортстрелка, прикрывавшего заднюю полусферу. Из-за наличия гипердвигателя, в экипаж был включен и астродроид, в задачи которого входила навигация и счисление координат для осуществления гиперпрыжка.", "Одной из примененных технологических новинок (см. примечание) стали раздвижные S-крылья. Они являются аэродинамическими плоскостями, улучшающими стабилизацию машины в атмосфере, что позволяет ARC-170 вести эффективный воздушный бой в планетарном пространстве и осуществлять не менее эффективные удары по наземным целям. Кроме этого S-крылья отводят излишнее тепло вырабатываемое двигателями и являются проекторами защитного поля. Кстати, по уровню защищенности, ARC-170 мог сравниться только, с не менее совершенным, тяжелым истребителем-бомбардировщиком BTL-В Y-Wing.", "Наличие мощных сенсоров, гипердвигателя и большой дальности полета (к слову, в пять раз больше чем у легендарного «крестокрыла») позволило использовать ARC-170 в качестве дальнего разведчика.", "Во время Войны Клонов эскадрильи ARC-170 наносили большой урон сепаратистскому флоту, принимая участие, как в небольших дальних рейдах, так и в крупных баталиях. Во время битвы за Корускант – одного из финальных сражений Войны Клонов – эскадрилья ARC-170, под командованием клона по имени Давиджаан (Davijaan) (позывной «Чудила» (Odd Ball)) прикрывала Оби-Вана и Энакина прорывавшихся к флагману сепаратистов. Позже, эта же эскадрилья, нанесла ощутимый удар по некоторым кораблям флота КНС. Именно пушками ARC-170, клон-пилотом Джай’галааром (Jai’galaar) над Като Неймодией был сбит Дельта-7 Пло Куна, в ходе выполнения «Приказа 66».", "Образовавшаяся Галактическая Империя в полной мере использовала технику, доставшуюся ей в наследство. Единственным внешним отличием имперских ARC-170 стала окраска. Теперь борта ARC-170 лишились пестрых цветов и индивидуальных эмблем, которыми могли похвастаться во время Войны Клонов; все истребители были перекрашены в светло-серый цвет с нанесением имперских опознавательных знаков. Точно неизвестно, насколько долго ARC-170 состояли на вооружении имперского флота.", "Впоследствии, опыт, полученный при создании и использовании ARC-170, был использован при разработке легендарного истребителя X-Wing", "Аддон работает и актуален на версии 1.17.0 и выше вплоть до 1.19.20"], "Published time:": "Oct 18th", "Views:": "883", "Downloads:": "248", "Credit:": null, "Progress:": "100% complete", "Game Version:": "Minecraft 1.17", "Tags:": ["New Content", "Addon", "Clone", "Starwars", "Air", "Bedrock", "Ship", "Republic", "Transport", "Bedrockedition", "Clonewars", "Star Wars", "Bedrockaddon"]},

However, have you ever felt like the Vanilla Minecraft deserts are a little bland and could use an overhaul?", "The purpose of the \"Desert Expansion\" mod is to rebreathe life back into the Desert biomes (Desert and Desert Hills biomes) by adding all new content to them. This mod aims to introduce new plants, mobs, food, structures and more whilst still retaining the Minecraft Vanilla feeling and style.", "There's new crops added into the Desert in the mod in order to make it look less bland. These are the Desert Grass crops that spawn all around it so that its not just flat sand like Vanilla and also the newer Cactai variant added in a recent update to the mod, this is just a smaller plant variant of cactus that drops the same block but adds variation so there's two different types of the plant and makes the desert prettier.", "Rattle Snakes spawn in the Desert and Desert Hills biomes and spawn in groups of up to 4. They drop green dye and are aggressive when approached.", "Golden Eagles have now been fixed in the mod and fly around in the Desert Hills biomes, they are quite rare so it might be tough to find them, but if you want to unlock the secrets to the Pyramids inside the tombs, you'll need to hunt one of these birds because they drop the Shiny Golden Keys that unlock the Sarcophagus' in the Pyramids.", "Camels spawn in the Desert in small groups and wander around, they cannot be ridden with a saddle but add more immersion to the desert and can be good farm animals to capture in a stable in your village.", "Scorpions also spawn in Desert and Desert Hills. They are pretty tough and spawn in groups of 1-2. They are uncommon in the desert but do a fair bit of damage and they are pretty slow in speed so they don't pose too much of a threat when you create distance with them. They drop scorpion stingers.", "There is also a collection of structures in the mod. Some of these structures contain exclusive mobs in or around them that I didn't mention in the mobs list before as they only spawn in the structures and not in the desert itself. The first structure is the Pyramid which is a standard classic style pyramid constructed entirely of sandstone blocks, housing 1-2 mob spawners inside. These spawners spawn Jackal Guardian mobs that attack you and protect the tomb below. The top floor lures you in with loot in new pots, although if you find the way down below to the bottom floor, you'll enter the treasure room and tomb. If you defeat the guardians and destroy their spawners, you may be lucky as the Pyramids have the chance to contain lots of amazing loot inside, although they are rarer structures. This was inspired by Ancient Egypt and Archaology which I believe should be in Minecraft. Inside these Pyramids is a Tomb room housing a Sarcophagus with an undead Pharaoh inside! Get a golden key from killing a Golden Eagle and right click on a Sarcophagus to open it and awaken the Pharaoh Boss!", "There is also the Desert Oasis that has a rare chance to spawn in the desert and is a body of water surrounded by desert trees. This structure exclusively spawns desert tortoises all around it. This is a great place to use as a water source in the desert to drink or use for potions and other purposes, although they spawn rarely to simulate reality.", "There are also desert trees that spawn around the desert, which are semi common and spawn Ostriches all around them and below the trees in the shade. These Ostriches also spawn naturally in the Desert too although they are rarer.", "There are new Fossils that spawn around the Desert in the form of Skeletons, these are huge prehistoric dinosaur like structures made of bones. Bones have been used in the Nether and elsewhere for skeletons but they also are not used as much as they should be, so they're now implemented as huge jurassic skeletons littered over the desert, they're rare but add more depth to the biome.", "The last structure are Desert Farms which spawn in the Desert Hills biomes. These farms house 1 Farmer Villager who lives in a Sandstone house, with a bed and chests. Outside, there are crops such as wheat that are fully grown and stabled Cows which graze on the farmland in the stable. Sometimes, due to the intense sun of the desert, the crops can be found broken or already harvested on the ground, which can be collected. These farms can be used as houses or places as rest when starting a new world if you get lost in the desert or to use to trade with the farmers instead of finding a village.", "The mod adds a new food type which are found in the Oasises. The Oasis trees have coconuts hanging from them. You can cut the coconuts with an axe and right click on a block to crack the coconuts into cracked coconut pieces and then eat them as food which restores a fair level of hunger."], "Published time:": "Aug 22nd", "Views:": "443", "Downloads:": "46", "Credit:": null, "Progress:": "100% complete", "Game Version:": "Minecraft 1.15", "Tags:": ["New Content", "Mobs", "Biomes", "Creatures", "Mob", "Biome", "Bosses", "Boss", "Desert", "Creature"]},

{"Title": "\"Better than Adventure!\" for Beta 1.7.3 - Timely updates revolving around the theme of \"Minecraft without the adventure update\" [1.7.4_02]", "Description": ["Overview", "Minecraft has changed a lot since its initial beta period in 2011. The game has grown substantially, and new features, mechanics and systems continue to be added even to this day. While this is all well and good, there are still players out there who don't enjoy the direction the game took post-release, or simply have nostalgia for beta minecraft and wish to return to a time without hunger, experience or enchantments with a few bells and whistles on. Just pick up your pickaxe, mine some diamonds and build a castle!", "Better Than Adventure is designed to appeal to these players who enjoy the simpler gameplay of the old beta versions of Minecraft, yet also want to try something new and exciting. Think of it as an \"alternate universe\" version of minecraft that attempts to maintain the look-and-feel of beta 1.7.3, while also keeping things fresh with new features and additions such as new blocks, biomes and quality of life improvements. Despite what the name implies, this mod isn't necessarily trying to offer something inherently ", "better", " than modern Minecraft, just something different. Think of it as a long-lost branch of Minecraft, what could have been if Notch and Jeb took the game in a slightly different direction all those years ago.", "While BTA is designed mostly to appeal to older players who grew up with beta, the aim of the mod in general is simply to offer an alterate take on the game. So if you're just looking for something new to enjoy, try this mod out too. You may like it", "Features", "Features", "Under the hood, BTA is very different from vanilla beta 1.7.3. The majority of existing bugs have been ironed out and fixed, and almost the entire game has been rewritten and optimised to make the development of new additions much, much easier. For example, the game’s implementation of McRegion has been rewritten to allow for 256 block-high worlds, the game now has native support for HD texture packs, and the block ID system has been overhauled to allow for thousands of blocks, instead of beta 1.7.3’s hard-limit of 256.", "The fun doesn’t end there though, BTA also offers a plethora of new features and mechanics to play around with. The biggest of which is probably the new “seasonal cycle”.", "Seasons", "Minecraft worlds now cycle through 4 seasons, over a span of 28 days (7 days per season). These seasons provide an interesting spin on survival gameplay; as the seasons change and winter begins to fall, the game will become progressively more challenging. Crops start to grow less often, mobs spawn more frequently, and the nights will become longer. It is important you plan around the changing seasons, stocking up on resources to survive the cold winter.", "Revamped Beta World Generation", "The iconic beta world generation has also been given a major touch-up in BTA. First and foremost, the sea-level has been risen to 128, which means 128 blocks of underground, and 128 blocks of overworld. This also means mountains can grow to twice the size they could than before, leading to even wackier terrain than normal.", "Biomes have been changed too, they now generate at around twice the size they used to, meaning no more ugly micro-deserts. Existing biomes have also been touched up to make them more unique, for example, swamplands now spawn with fields of algae and mossy trees, and seasonal forests spawn groves of cherry trees that shine a bright pink in the spring.", "Creative Mode ", "One thing that beta 1.7.3 and below did lack was a functioning creative mode where you can test out contraptions and plan builds in a world with infinite blocks and health. This has been added to BTA, however its not just a simple port of beta 1.8’s creative mode.
